       "'Play this game.  Play this game a lot. hard to find enough players the older Moskito version is for 4 players only, the newer HiG version is for 3-5.  Great political game, more  balanced with the newer version.  Need to do well in 1st or 2nd regional election. Sid Sackson Personal Collection 1986 Edition Words fail me. Met Karl-Heinz in Essen (2003) very modest man who made a near perfect game. With so many phases each round, there is a lot to keep track of.  Fortunately, I downloaded the player aids and read up on all the corrections to the English translation.  The four or five hours in our initial game seemed to fly by in no time.  This is one German game that most closely resembles a Francis Tresham game. THE greatest of all. This game have all it takes. The best political game, period. It\\'s so good, I\\'m shocked there haven\\'t been imitators. Perfect example of theme informing design.  Brilliant game, that\\'s all I can say. Simply a superb game.  Long, but incredibly engrossing.  The Poll Cards are a small blemish on an otherwise almost flawless design. Definitely a gamer\\'s game.  I think with more plays, and the right group this should move to a 10.  EDIT: Upgraded to 10, best game I have played. Wow I\\'ve played this game numerous times and it still retains its replayability.  This game never plays the same way twice, the elements of negotiation and strategy make this a classic game.  Its a good length (4-5 hours) that encourages socialization (even if its simply in the manner of, hey, you just screwed me over!)  If you\\'ve never played it, grab 4 of your closest gamer friends, several six-packs of german beer (or a couple bottles of wine) and expect a really good evening. Wonderful, deep, fine - kind of like good Barolo, this one is better with age. Perfect blend of old-school depth/length with new-school elegant interlocking mechanics. And the theme is cool, too. REALLY glad I made the investment. Based on 2 plays, both solitaire - says alot about a game, eh? Truly this game is great.  A fantastic design-- if only there was enough time to play it more often. THE game, I always wanted. It has one of the most complicated mechanisms, at least among euros. Still it works! and works beautifully. It\\'s like Republic of Rome in some sense. It has the same depth, tension and level of player interaction. Yet it\\'s much more controllable and avoids unpredictable luck. Sophisticated, elegant and deep. This is the game, my personal n.1. Many strategic and tactical decisions to be made. It needs planning, dealing and also skill in taking opportunities when they present. The theme may seems dry, but once you play you\\'re grabbed and the 4 hours a match usually last fly away.  Reccomended.  Ownership and use is necessary for every true geek.  YSD This is \"THE GAME\" If the topic of this game was anything other than German politics it would be the #1 rated game on the list. The game takes 4 hours, yes... but it will be the best 4 hours you ever spent playing a game. Just one point, if you don\\'t like games that have a lot of options, lots of player interaction, a great \"screw you\" factor, takes longer than 45 minuets, or requires you to use your brain and keep your head in the game, please don\\'t play this game.  The first game in a very very long time that I got excited about days in advance before getting to play it again.  Outstanding.  Can\\'t say enough about this one.  #3 or 4 all-time for me.  Probably will grow to a 10 long-term...  Edit - It\\'s grown.  3rd best game I have ever played.  Upgrade to 10 where it belongs. Hands down the best German game I have ever played.  So many things going on, unlimited strategy: just brilliant.  Perfect mix of luck and calculation, a real nail bitter.  Cooperation, resource management, biding, back stabbing, this game has it all. Fantastic game! There\\'s nothing actually particularly complex about this game, but there is a lot going on.  Seven separate elections that you can influence, party membership, the national opinions, your party platform.  Five player game with four newbies took us a little under five hours with a dinner break, so I could see it getting under four.  I could play this a lot. I was finally able to get in a game of Die Macher at a con this past weekend and everyone\\'s comments about the game proved to be true.  Incredible number of options; you\\'re always paying attention to what\\'s going on; plays in four hours, but seems like one-and-a-half.  Tremendous!! A four hour game that never feels like four hours - truly a great game.  I really think that if you played this more than once a year, that you could trim the time a little bit as well.   This is simply my favorite game of all time.  It has many different mechanisms (auctions, turn order, placements, multiple options, resource management) and is a very intense four hour experience that is also an excellent simulation of electoral politics as well as the best game of all time.  I own the 1997 edition from RGG, which improved on the very poor components and sometimes fiddly math from the first edition game, which I started playing around 1990 although I never owned a copy.  Only problem is the steep learning curve, substantially longer playing time (not an issue with me but it is for many people) and finding the right group to play it with.  Definitely better with 5 than 4, and I usually pre-arrange most game sessions in advance although I have had fun in some pick-up games recently.  UPDATE:  Rating still a 10, still #1 on my all-time list, pleased that I got in two full games in less than a week!  (A record except the one time I made it to a tournament final.)  My best description in a nutshell:  Die Macher is truly the Cadillac of all boardgamers. BR Amazing.   Well worth getting a group to play.  Very much a brain burner but nothing too complicated.  *************  Playing my recent games with Tom Rosen and crew prove that 5 player can be played in 3-3.5 hours. Can\\'t play this game enough. :) I like it a lot!  You have to commit some serious time to playing this one...Yet, if you have the time and committment from your friends--it is TOTALLY worth it. One of the most mind-numbingly brain-burning games I have ever experienced, and OH WHAT AN EXPERIENCE! A fantastic blend of hand management, majorites, and negotiation. You owe it to yourself to try this game if you get the opportunity. All games must bow to this, the one true master! 2004 Impressions are good after first 4-player game.  It\\'s highly strategic; planning ahead and cooperation (coalitions) is vital.  Rating might increase with play.  We played a couple of rules wrong, and I believe it\\'s even better with five players.  8/2008 Finally managed to play a complete 5-player game within acceptable time.  (Having (at least) one player knowing the game well really helps.)  All players start the game on an equal field with all the same possibilities and \"enough\" resources.  Winning is just a matter of good planning and knowing which fights to stand and which to ignore.  This is a treasure chest in boardgaming and there\\'s still a lot of depth to be discovered.  Rating up 9 -> 10.   Bought 3/2003 Works flawlesly, not for everyone although. One play every 3 months at most, but always a very welcome game. I\\'d play more if the game was longer. 4/18/06 - (Hans im Glück) - played this once and had to have a copy. Karl-Heinz Schmiel you are a game designer genius! Brilliant game.  So many fascinating, interlocking mechanisms all running simultaniously.  Very long, but worth every minute. The length of the game would preclude me from playing this often, but I thought it was FANTASTIC! Highlights: 2009, 2016. Box structurally sound but dirty with a little whitening around the edges, one corner  has a small split Game pieces like new  The first time I played, I spent 2 hours miserably asking why did I agree to fill this out. (I can understand how the learning curve could turn some off.) Then everything clicked and I realized just how great this game was.There are allot of mechanics, none overly complicated. You want to play this with 5 people who want to play, 1 or 2 who have had their arms twisted can easily ruin it for all.    Hands down, my Favorite game.  Has a two turn learning curve.  The first two games I played I lost horribly.  Went out and purchased immeadiately after 2nd game.  I have played this so often, that I cannot even remeber the last time I used an original scorecard.  There are some differences between second and third editions.  My ranking is based upon second edition rules. Outstanding. I don\\'t know how else to describe this game. There are never enough resources to do everything you\\'d like (or even need) to do well in every stage of the game and it\\'s these agonizing decisions that everyone needs to make that keep the game a toss up until the very end. I have now played this game a number of times.  A very interesting system.  It is very \"full\" (lots of tasks) to it takes someone with a wargamer background to be able to last.  But every action by another player effects your own issues so is it like you are participating in another\\'s turn.  Often when I have played this game two if not three of the players were new to the game; though some had tried to learn the rules in advance.  The first game I played took six hours as well as the second game; the third took seven hours.  In a forced game I could see going five hours but it is far nicer to pace one\\'s self and just say it will take six (it has taken this long even with all players having played before).  It seems that the actual playing time can be faster, but when rules & setup time are added, this is a long game.  It is not super complicated as much as there are many steps in every turn making the process take time.  Those new to the game get the grasp of it enough to make their decisions after one or two rounds (of six); though in every case they would have wanted to try things diffently if played again.  THIS GAME IS MUCH BETTER WITH THE HELP SHEETS THAT CAN BE FOUND HERE AT BGG; they keep track of all the steps.  I do think it takes playing once or twice in order to get the management of money & resources down so that a stratagy could be followed better during playing.  It is a most interesting way to set up an election game, still making me think the same format could be used to represent the primary process in American presidential elections.  I also have a copy of the original \"blue box\" edition which has only four parties and seems a little different in its structure. (I have never played this version.)  I also have the newer Valley Games printing but find the shorter five turn version ruins the game. Reprint just arrived from Valley Games, and I\\'m really looking forward to trying this one out.  Then I can finally decide whether Ra or Die Macher should win the constant struggle between them, heh -- UPDATE: Wow!  This game has everything.  It seems far more daunting than it should because of the number of phases on each turn, but most of the phases are pretty straightforward, and everything ties together so nicely that the time really flies by.  I\\'m normally not a fan of games with too much luck or chaos, but this one gives you just enough control to make it work. I can\\'t get enough!  Purchased: March 21, 2006 Superb.  It\\'s long, but it\\'s tense and exciting. offervalue:9 Doesn\\'t make it to the table anymore, so I resort to opening the box and fondly recalling the times I\\'ve played it. If there\\'s ever a Die Macher group that convenes in the area, I want to be part of it. One of the great gaming experiences. A true classic.  My favorite game with 5.  Bought September 9, 2006 My favorite game.  As close to gaming perfection as I have seen. This game is a great example of the concept of \"emergence\": many simple systems interact with one another to create a whole that is more complicated than the sum of its parts.  A deep, deep game with lots of thinking to do.  Plus, it\\'s lots of fun, and doesn\\'t feel like 5 hours long. Probably the best election game I\\'ve played. The older I get, the more I realise how well the designers understood how elections work, and how political parties operate in this world. Really runs players through the gamut of what most political parties have to do to win elections. Complex but not obtusely so (although the rulebook could be better organised). At five hours, it\\'s probably still manageable but considering that you\\'re going to be going through the same steps for each election anyway, I recommend going for the shorter game variant in the Valley Games version to keep the monotony down.  Shockingly fun and enjoyable for such a dull-sounding theme.  After a single play (and with several rules misplayed), I can tell this is my #1 game.  I feel its depth and complexity, the rich and daunting engineering marvel... I could continue in hyperbole, but these words will not aid you.  Pro:  A true gamer\\'s game, requiring thought and forethought.  While it is LONG, the time flies by and never drags.  Shorter version available.  Con:  Opinion polls are very powerful, perhaps too much so; perhaps there is a variant to mitigate this? May be longer than you like, so plan ahead for this one.  Don\\'t make it the last game of the night.  Complex play mechanics require at least one throw-away game unless playing with veterans.  If you are all new to the game, re-read the rules carefully before AND AFTER playing.  There\\'s a lot going on.  Bottom line:  Long, yes.  Complex, yes.  Is it worth the trouble?  Definitely YES.  With the right group, Die Macher is a game that will become the centerpiece of your game nights.  (This information based on the Valley Games version) Recently purchased during the Le Valet\\'s boxing day sale. Never played. Heard lots about this game.  Played once so far. I was quite impress by the depth of the game in question. Lots of decision taking. Some decisions are short term, why others could pay off more in the end game.  When we played, we were 4 players and we were all newbies at this game. So we took it slow and did step by step in trying in figure out what we were doing and why and what are the pros and cons of each decision.  It\\'s something you need to play 2-3 times in a short period of time to fully understand this game. It\\'s a gamers game with lots of meat.  Never thought that politics could be this much fun.  Got another copy of the game in shrinkwrap for trade at the Le Valet`s summer garage sale. My brain-burner of choice, if only I could get my group to play it more often. Never tried with less than five players. Played it for the first time with 5 gamers. I like this game a lot. It has a unique feeling. I ended up ok although I usually can\\'t play it properly. I guess I had lucky! Most of the time polls are a bit frustrating because we often buy innocuous ones. That\\'s a major complaint about the game due to its randomness but I still think that despite all of that Die Macher is a different game that feels differently and makes the difference especially when compared to new boardgames which, most of them, seem the same. I like the way everything is combined. The difficulty in choosing the right issue to be for or against, a struggle against chaos and randomness. I believe that if a player doesn\\'t stick too much on his luck and manages to do well or at least try to do well in major elections, he is able to win the game. Opinion polls may destroy a strategy on the short run but I really am convinced that that is not possible if polls are controlled in the long run, saying 2 elections ahead. If players can get 30 votes in a long term election probably is a good idea to grab those 30 votes before a poll goes wrong. Plus, good (forced or not) coalitions can make a difference in the national board which can be important. Getting media control is also an excellent way to get points from the national board and also to buy cheap polls - I guess that if a player has media control over a region the other players often tend to let him grab the poll.   1. Polls may be bought. If a player wants that poll if he thinks that is a critical region/election he may buy the poll or even try to control it using the media. This is a decision made by the player. The key word here is decision. If, for some reason, the player can\\'t buy that poll he should have prepared himself better for that situation by: a) saving the money needed as he thought on that region as a key election. b) preparing himself for the case that he can\\'t get the poll by playing ahead making some damage control  2. Issue cards are random as in all games that play with cards. In Die Macher there are always 4 elections in dispute and with those 4 elections, 10 issue cards are open. Players have the possibility of choosing from 6 cards to play as a party campaign so, I guess it\\'s not just about luck, it often is about trying to get everything. It\\'s better to control the elections on the long term because those regions only have a single card showing so, no more complaints about luck on the cards because, although they can make things easier they are not impossible to control especially in future (with a single or two cards showing) elections.  3. Dice. Well, there\\'s nothing to do with dice. Sometimes they work for, sometimes they work against. It\\'s just how they work. But they work like that in all games with dice and, in my opinion, they are not that relevant. I believe in odds and, although a player can have luck (or lack of it) for all over the game, that\\'s against the odds so it\\'s more likely to have players with luck and with no luck during the game.  Die Macher is an euro game that is all about making the right decisions and try to \"cut losses\" where possible. There\\'s no way a player with lack of strategy and well playing can win this game.  This is definitely one of the games of my life.  I really enjoy this game, too bad I can\\'t get more players to play more often.  It can seem more complicated then it is.  You have several steps that you execute for each state and you just have to follow the sequence.  I think it takes playing through a couple of states for a new player to see how everything works together and start to get the hang of it. Deep game that requires you always be thinking/planning. Who would have thought a game on german politics could be so engrossing. Although it takes many hours to play, the time just flies by because the game is so engaging and fun.  A staggeringly brilliant design & execution -- far and away the richest gaming experience I have ever come across!  Not the easiest game to teach and learn, but well worth every minute of it.  Lots of *fun*, too -- backstabbing, temporary alliances, trash talk, and frighteningly topical observations & commentary.   Nicolas First play took seven hours, and I wanted to play it again the next day.  That might say enough right there.  A little something for everybody -- a little auctioning, a little dice, a little negotiating, a little card management, a little money management, but it all works together.  Love at first play.  Takes a long time to play, but it\\'s a hoot the whole time you\\'re playing it! WOW Components are neat and functional. Well-themed. So many elements and mechanics are intergrated and system is complex, but game itself flows smoothly. Proper satire on actual politics. Good proportion of luck and skill, open and hidden information. It takes 4~5 hours but never feels long -it\\'s very fun.   So many variables, so many options, never enough resources to do everything.  This game presents so many decisions, requires flexibility, resource management, strategy and thinking on your feet.  Each game has the potential for a completely different structure and strategy.  I love this game. WOW. Played this for the first time last night and was really impressed. We struggled through the rules and the 1st turn, but then once we got the mechanics down, this game sped way up and the brillance of it\\'s design became clear. There are SO many ways to score points in this that it;s overwhelming at first to know what to  do and what to prioritize. I\\'d love to see this one come out in English!   ...[b] Abstract [/b]..._____[]_____...[b]Themed [/b]..... .........[b] Luck [/b]...________[]__...[b] Skill [/b]........... ......[b] Simple [/b]..._________[]_...[b] Complex [/b]... ..[b] Strategic [/b]...___[]_______...[b] Tactical [/b].... ....[b] Friendly [/b]..._______[]___...[b] Cutthroat [/b].. .......[b] Fiddly [/b]...______[]____...[b] Elegant [/b].....

There are numerous way to mitigate and manipulate the luck and a true master would never need to blame poor luck for poor playing. Learning Curve - You will not be an expert at this game the first time you play it.  It will take several plays to learn all the nuances and manuvers you can use to plan your victory Length of Play - It will take you a long time to play this when you are learning but with experience this game will play in 3 hours still long but not the ridiculous exagerations of 5 to 6 hours. If you will accept these things as a given and do what it takes to truely experience this game you will find yourself in the thralls of one of the greatest games ever made If you cannot accept these things you probably will never like this game.   It takes a long time to make a great bottle of Wine and you probably won\\'t get it right the first time.  Either you have the determination to do it or you drink wine coolers. My favourite multi-player game. The mechanics blend so well together. This is a MUST HAVE in any collection. The rules are not too difficult (esp. with player aids available on bgg), but the gameplay (ie: how the rules actually relate to each other) is much more difficult. Persevere, DM is awesome! Outstanding. The most elegant game I ever played. I thought for a long time EL GRANDE was unbeatable in that department, but I was wrong. This game drags down 6 hours of your life, leaving behind one of the most satisfying game experiences you might ever have. I\\'m reluctant of giving a 10 after only one game... but for sure, this game deserves it. I\\'ll leave it a 9 for now. Perhaps someday after more games it will become a 10  2007-06-10: Played for second time... WOW... amazing game. I regret I can\\'t give this game a 10, only because I\\'m not always willing to spend my eurogaming sesion playing only one game. Besides the playing time, this game is perfect.  2007-09-21: This game deserves the perfect Rating regardless of the playing time.  Highly recommended for Heavy Eurogamers. WOW! WOW!  Hands down the best game I have EVER played. Despite it\\'s length there\\'s never a dull moment. My favorite game. Only one word to describe this game EXCELLENT!!!!! My favorite political game and 4-5 hour playing game.  A gamer\\'s game.  This is a completely unique game and should be in every serious gamers collection.  Make sure you have 4 to 6 hours and 4 friends that can devote the time to this game.  This game does not disappoint.  A hint - Do not underestimate the importance of the one who is setting himself up to win the last two elections.  He who wins these two elections will have the final say on the National Agenda, and thus be in the best position to score many VPs. Own both a 1st Edition (Blue Box, 4 players only) and a Second Edition (Max 5, different rules, Yellow Box)  1st Edition (Corrected games log: 2 plays, 03-08-07, 08-16-07) The 1st edition of Macher is noticeably more of a rough-cut than the 2nd, but the game system is still recognizable, and the final product is still very fun. Everything that one would expect from the later version is here in spades: media control, shadow cabinet play, but the system is slightly less tuned and more opaque in many phases, particularly the conversion of meeting markers into votes, and the extremely convoluted final scoring.  I like playing this version of the game rather than the 2nd when we only have 4 players, mainly because the 1st seems to be slightly nastier and more effectively tuned for the 4 scale.  A rule that I particularly like is the way the party platform changes, here it is a completely deterministic, voluntary choice thing, and I would actually like to convert that rule to the 2nd edition, because I think it adds another interesting player choice into the mix without sacrificing anything in the process.  I will say though, the final scoring is a headache your first time through, and the scores seem positively gaudy when one is used to the later iteration of the system.   2nd Edition  Masterful, deep, intriguing, there is nothing I can say negative about this game other than the fact that due to its political nature the scale should be a minimum 4. The 4 hours this takes feel like less than 1 to me, as it pulls me in completely. Hard to find a game with a more long term strategy element to it either, this will reward the person thinking 3 elections ahead time and time again with a big fat mandate and the score to show for it. The balance on this game is utterly superb as well, early election victories lead to more points for media markers, yet lower the number of national issues you\\'re going to successfully dictate. Small elections might offer a small mandate, but they might be an easy way to push your agenda, or get your media on top. Control the media? Your agenda becomes the people\\'s agenda. Cash in early chips and go for an absolute majority to further your own ends? Or hold out and try to push that multiplier a little bit higher? Absolutely everything I\\'m looking for in a game...  Scale is by far and away best with 5, though I am willing to play it with 4. With 3, the game just loses too much to be worth pulling out.  On an aside, I prefer to play this with the following variants: - Money can change hands - Flood Rule - Shifting National Opinion Rule  Notes on the 3rd Edition (Valley Games):  A minus for the graphical design on the cards, a plus for the graphical design on the boards. Some of the issue cards are too similar for their own good, and are harder to tell apart at a distance than the HiG edition. On the plus, the icons for where the region card / shadow cabinet cards / coalition tiles should go is a nice add.  The rules changes are brutal though: I played this once with the exchange pool rules as written (i.e.: pool starts at 6, no way to actually add cards to it, it just stays at 6 with cards rotating in and out based on media control) and didn\\'t care for the restriction that it placed on the media. I would lobby actively against playing with the rule again and would likely opt out of playing it if a majority wanted to play with it.   The short game rules are an atrocity and I would not be willing to play the game with them. They cut off a chunk of the game\\'s long term planning and excise, perhaps, 1-1.5 hours at most from play, a tiny time savings for the kind of things they remove. This game is a beast.  Once it starts to click this game is a beautiful machine that is actually an exceptional simulation of electoral politics (if not a bit cynical).I\\'ve enjoyed my games and my group didas well - too bad 2 of them moved to the other side of the country and we haven\\'t been able to replace them yet.  Also, having a young child means I won\\'t have enough free time to play again for the foreseable future. Now with 3 plays under my belt - two as teacher - I still love this game.  I have won handily, been in the middle of the pack, and been last dismally - loved every game. Not Complex - struggle through one turn and it becomes really easy.  Five newbies played in my first game.  We finished in just under 4 hours!  I see it as a three hour game next time.  This game is near perfect!  Play at least once each year.  Love this game.  Rewards play with experienced players. Still at 10! (7-12-17) A \"Holy Grail\" of a game.  I can\\'t imagine ever feeling I\\'ve cracked this one, it\\'s not the complexity that makes this unsurmountable, it\\'s the staggering options which open up each turn.  Remarkable on so many levels that I\\'m forced to reconsider if my other 10\\'s are really up to this monumental achievement.  Wow for so many reasons, but mostly for making me feel I\\'m not worthy to play this. Just has everything, depth of tactics, good board/pieces, desire to return again...again...and again... pretty much the best balanced game for future planning, short term planning, strategy, luck and interaction WOW! Finally got around to playing this and was blown away. I\\'d be willing to play this any time it hits the table. Excellent political strategy game. Brilliant and engaging from start to finish. This is the grandest of all Euro Games. One of, if not, the best game. Great length, decisions. This should be top 5 Its as good as everyone says...:-)  Unfortunately, its way too long for most of the people that I know with whom I usually game.  I definitely prefer five players for this game.  Four is a fine game but there seems to be less options for coalitions. A player aid listing all the different phases with the respective actions is a must for streamlining this game and following along.  I love this game as I always lose track of time and never realize just how long it does take!  I think this is one of my three favorite games of all times. It takes some time (about 3-5 hours), but the best thing is: You can play it, WHILE you learn the rules. All the mistakes you make in the first round, don´t make you loose the game. You can win anyway. The game is so well balanced, so complex, has no \"luck\"- factor and is yet so easy to learn... fantastic! (and it gives a quite nice overview about how politics really work - \"We stand for \"We are absolutely against atomic energy!!!\" - unless the people want it!\" If you like: - El Grande - Making of a president - Libertee - Princes of the renissance  then you should defenitly buy this game. Last played with Donovan, Pam, Charlie and Brian R. on 11/9/2007. A four-five hour game that feels like a one and a half hour game it is so constantly exciting. The desicions are really tough. You do feel like a cold-blooded manipulating politician grabbing votes without believing in any of your policies. It\\'s great to see people smearing their opponents, playing the media and forcing empty coalitions against their opponents wills. Brilliant game.  Another favorite.  Very fun abstract strategy game themed around politics.  Somewhat difficult for beginners. Die Macher is one of the most satisfying games in my collection. Granted, the board looks like an aborted Powerpoint sales presentation and the theme seems about as interesting as C-span on a Monday morning. Throw in the atrocious looking clip art cards and I admit, the game looks like a complete train wreck. The cards are an embarrassment and make the game a lot harder than it should be. The shadow government cards also use a weird symbology that completely detracts from the game\\'s atmosphere. I understand the reasoning behind making the game language independent, but realistically all that it does is weaken the whole experience. I\\'m actually tempted to try and get some custom cards printed, as there are quite a few nice replacement designs floating around here on BGG. The game would certainly benefit from a visual overhaul.   Don\\'t be fooled though, because despite the aesthetics, Die Macher is a fascinating game. Every turn is filled with so much planning and decision making that the game\\'s four or five hour play time absolutely flies by. Every mechanism in the game is so closely interwoven with each other that I can\\'t imagine ever mastering it. On top of all this wonderful decision making, the game squeezes in some negotiation and temporary alliances...all of which further guide and influence the experience as the game develops.  I want to play this game a hundred more times, I really do. It\\'s that good. I just need to make it less scary looking... There\\'s a lot to do, with limited time in which to do it, but I never felt frustrated like I do with some games. The most fulfilling game I\\'ve ever played. There is a quality to this game that awes -- yet is hard to put into words.  Its how it meshes so many constantly evolving mechanics together in an effortless way that makes the game play lightly yet keeps your head buried in strategy.  Its a unique feeling that only the better Knizia designs come close to matching. Also, unlike many other designs it has enough hidden information that you can build a hand to a hidden strategy (there is variety in gameplay that is not introduced entirely by random means). About a 3 or 3.5 hour game for us. Karl-Heinz Schmiel is the master at achieving strategic depth *without gratuitous complexity*.  I\\'ve had three plays now and every time confirms the fact that I should be playing this more often. Rating based on one play at BGG.Con.  This game was everything I\\'d been led to believe.  Great fun! Aparte de ser un juegazo, te ayuda a entender cómo funcionan las cosas realmente con las campañas electorales.  Intenso. Truely excellent game - such deep strategy and so many choices to make all the time.  Almost no downtime for any player as everyone is always invloved at all stages of the game.  The only thing I would mark it down for is the fact that you have *so* much stuff to think about and keep track of, which wouldn\\'t usually be such a bad thing but in this case you have to repeat the same thing seven times over at least four hours.  Still an excellent game though - one of the best I\\'ve ever played. The Best in game design there is around. Schmiel was way ahead of his time. There are games about drawing cards and playing them, there are games about auctioning stuff which\\'ll give you [advantage A through C]. All of which are ok to good in their own way, but this is a game about decision-making and it\\'s dripping with theme and - oddly enough - german politics have never been more interesting than in this game. After some other games it never itches me to become a second Mehdorn (CEO of the DB - german railways), I don\\'t care about being a manufacturer nor does getting in the natural ressources business appeal to me in any way. But after a game of \"Die Macher\" you really got behind the taste of power. Man, how could it have taken me seven years inbetween sessions of this masterpiece? It\\'s even better than I remembered it to be and by far less complicated than I had in  mind from last time. Well, been through several game rules in the past years...must be the experience.  Summary: The most enriching gaming experience I ever had with really minor luck elements. Calculated risk and decision-making is what I\\'d rather call it.   This game is excellent.  There is not much that I\\'d rather play if you can get five together for the game, and have the time. Always BGG Game # 1   Own the Hans im GlÃ¼ck (HiG) variant.- The pink color for PDS/Die Linke in the Valley Games variant is better than the blue color in the HiG game.- The faces on the Shadow Cabinet card in the Mosiko variant are great.- interesting how the Topics stay the same, genetic engineering, social security, security (today anti terror), health care reform, nuclear technology of the HiG game are still a top topic in Germany. Elegant complexity. It\\'s a lot more interesting than it looks or the theme (German politics) sounds. Intriguing short vs long-term choices. Room for diplomacy and some role-play. Rules are not intuitive; however, once you learn the game, they make sense. Due to all the factors involved, you can\\'t tell who is truly winning until the end. You always feel like you are \"in it\" rather than on auto-pilot. Well worth scheduling. Good to have someone who can GM to keep things moving. *I was prepared to dislike the new streamlined version, specifically because of the lack of a national board, but was pleasantly surprised. The graphics are clear. Valley Games version. Some splitting on one corner of lid (not separated yet). Very minor wear on another corner Quite Simply The Most Fun One Could Ever Have Playing Board Games. An utterly absorbing game, with little downtime and thrilling finale. Brand new with perfect shrinkwrap. Free shipping in CONUS, will pay $10 towards shipping otherwise. My favorite multi-player game.  Well worth the investment in time this game takes. My favorite \"long\" game. with 3 words and an article: The Complete gaming experience! I\\'d give it a 9,5 but rated with 10 coz it\\'s a 1986 design,amazing!!! One day I will win... (again) Complex. I love. Lot\\'s of interacting systems. One of the best This title is quite simply one of the best examples of thorough and elegant game design ever produced. So many factors are at work, yet none of them bog down the game; simple mechanics that interact in complex ways, I once read. The balance is beautifully crafted. This is a game that every hardcore gamer should play. It goes to 11. My favorite game. It has been years since my last play, but the game is absolutely great. Quintessential long euro, it does not really have slow moments. You spend the whole 3-5 hours thinking. Simply the best game EVER!  Buy it, play it, then, when you are done playing it, play it again. Beyond a doubt my favourite euro game..play it by myself..if you can believe it and actually always make it through to the end...little surprised it hasn\\'t gotten any online play.. Possibly my favorite game of all time.  Including wargames. Who would have thought the German political process could be so much fun? German version Amazing game. What more can I say. Best game in the universe ever made.  Perhaps a VERY advanced future civilization somewhere far away might create a better game, but I doubt it. This game is fantastic and it really is quite intuitive to play.  Set it up and go through one election and everyone should be ready to go, in our game we didn\\'t even start over but continued until completion.  With three players it took us 4 hours to play a short game and the first hour and a half was trolling through the first election with the rulebook.  I am so excited to get this to the table again! This is a long game but filled with a lot of fun, even if the rule book and art work are a bit dull. This is the very first copy of the game off the production line by Valley Games. Signed by the designer Karl-Heinz Schmiel. I love the complexity and strategy in this game.  The public opinion polls are probably my only gripe. THIS IS THE GAME! just perfect! I think this is the only game when I lose, I was just happy to play, hard to get on the table I consider this game to be the proto-modern Euro: complicated with many interlocking systems and lacking in aggression (although, you certainly do work against the leader). In that domain, I don\\'t think it\\'s been surpassed. One of my 10s Klassiek spel. Mooi het spelen op de verschillende borden. Daardoor wel ingewikkeld en door de speltijd komt het niet vaak genoeg op tafel om er echt handig in te worden. Verder interesseert het thema mij zeer. I got a bad feeling that I\\'ll never get to play this.  Flawless design. Beautifully balanced, tension-filled, crafty gaming from the moment you start right up to election day. Timeless.  I\\'ve heard it said that Die Macher is a game about calculation. I disagree. In my experience Die Macher is played on instinct. There\\'s no calculation you can do which tells you where to put a media token, or when to play a party conference. You do it, or don\\'t do it, but I\\'ve never met anyone who tried to \\'figure it out\\'. I\\'ve won many games and never calculated a thing.  Maybe that\\'s a product of the era in which it was released. At the time we were playing Civ, Britannia, Kingmaker. We played Die Macher and it was clearly a different animal. I believe it still is. First edition How is this so good?  I\\'m serious:   How? Brilliant game.  It appears at first glance to be very complicated but it is not.  Play through one turn for \"training pruposes\", and it all starts to gel together. Yes, it takes hours to play, but you are in it the whole time, engrossed in the gameplay and working all the angles to get your efforts to pay off.  12/2011  A remarkable game.  It doesn\\'t seem to take as long as it does. Constant tension and deal making. Really excellent. 37x27x7 The theme appears to be incredibly dry on the surface- each player represents a German political party trying to maximize their number of seats in 7 state elections.  Doesn\\'t sound very promising until you sit down and play it.  First, the game feels like the best contemporary Euros being released today - it does not have that dated feel that most 80s games has.  Second, while there are a fair amount of rules for the 10 phases, the mechanics work very smooth and are logical.  Each round is the same so once you get past the first round, it speeds up.  The rules are not fiddly, nor do you have to memorize a bunch of cards or buildings.  While long, there is little down time since each player is involved in each of the 10 phases per round.  Where the game really shines is its combination of tactics and strategy.  Each round, you are vying for seats in the current election so you are manipulating the issues of concern, setting up meetings, and trying to take over the media.  However, you also have information about the next 3 elections although you have less information on the elections further away.  Thus, you have to also be positioning yourself for future elections.  There are meaty decisions every step of the way and balancing your resources are critical.  Do I change my party platform to try to win the next election at the risk of getting more out of step with the overall nation\\'s opinions.  Which elections do I want to focus on and which ones do I want to set up or force a coalition.  I was amazed at how much depth this game has.  I also like the mix of mechanics that include auctions, area control, negotiation, resource management, etc. I really would like to play this at Origins 2012.  I will not have a copy with me.  I could probably teach if people were so inclined.  * Landmark political game with many excellent features. Players take control of a political party in Germany, making decisions that will affect their performance in a series of election. The main route to being successful in the game is matching your party\\'s key issues with the issues of the regions in which the elections are taking place. This isn\\'t always possible however as many of the regions have conflicting key issues, some of which will be at odds with the political parties. The are four ways to score victory points in the game, the main being directly linked to the amount of votes a party receives in each election, but other points are acquired through media control, party membership, and matching their key issues with national issues at the end of the game. \\'Die Macher\\' is unquestionably the best game depicting politics ever made. There are so many interweaving mechanisms at play here, providing players with a wealth of options, and it genuinely feels faithful to its subject matter.  Die Macher English edition has improved language accessibility and design artwork. This game is a masterpiece in the political arena.  Love the different ways of influencing election outcomes and the usage of coalitions.  Definitely one of my top games.   Best politics game so far. Love it. la genialidad hecha juego, denso, inmersivo, largo pero muy emocionante, ojalá pueda conseguir una copia. This game is amazing. Only 1 play so far but I wanted to play it again after it was done. Nils   40/40 new  We were only able to play a 3 player game.  Which is a shame because it is excellent at higher player count.  We experienced that fact at Gen Con.  If you have not played this at 4 or especially 5....YOU MUST.  played at gen con 5 player.  6hr game that flew by.  sooo good Kickstarter, ETA Dec. 2019 A masterpiece. Tense, engrossing, brilliant in every way. Absolutely impressing! Heavy Boardgames Top Games 4.34 complexity rating is not so accurate. Real rating should be somewhere around 3. In my experience 1 game with 4 players, including rules explanations, is about 3 hours. Wow, what a game. The rules did take some time to learn, but the game is played in distinct steps, and so it\\'s not as hard to learn as you might think. I wish this would get more table time than it does. Takes about 4 hours to play. Such a good game.  Seems complicated at the start, however, once the game starts, the game aids really help the turns run smoothly. I love this game, but very rarely get a group that\\'s willing to jump in and play. It\\'s one of those games that\\'s long and tedious at times, but the hours played seem to just fly by.  Best with the full set of five players. A great game with many decisions and directions. not very complex in rules terms but in the the fact of so many decisions to make.... Games can be played in shorter amount of time as the game implies, 4 hours!?! if you know the rules! and it never feels as long as it actually is! This version has superior art, but the change in the rules were for the worse.  The removal of the \\'national directives\\' made little sense, making the change of party policies a must. Not sure that makes much sense. THE Boardgame. Count me in anytime! Elections, bluffing, backstabbing, changing your parties or the peoples opinions, excitement all the time. What else do you need? Jugado I am in constant amazement at how incredible this game is. To think that it was designed in the 80\\'s is just a testament to how innovative the system is. Please note I have the 1st edition, which supports 3 or 4 players. Every little mechanism in the game feels like a political machination in your grand design. From adding meetings (cubes) to recruiting your Shadow Cabinet to setting up Coalitions, it just works. Not easy to teach by a long shot, so expect your first game with new players to be a 4-5 hour slogfest of rules corrections. But after that, you are ready to roll. 80\\'s German politics were never so fun! An easy 10 for me and one of the greatest games I have ever played. What a game!!! 0.25 minus for the long playing time (probably after few games it\\'ll be less a problem) and 0.25 minus for the  card not very well different to recognize at first sight. Edit. 4p in 3h...good improvement  Bought 03/02/2014 完美的德式遊戲,玩起來異常的激烈 I love this game but hard to get plays in.  I enjoy the interaction and planning. This is a game I had always wanted to play...once. Having finally gotten it and played it I am not about to trade it. This is one of the best games in my collection and I expect to play it many more times. The theme may not be sexy but the gameplay is tremendous. Superb game. It would be a ten but for the length of the game. Wow!!! What a game. I had this one for 10 years in my game closet. Finally played it about 2 months ago... Can\\'t wait to play it again. It flows well, table talks are a must, 4 hours of pure pleasure... Didn\\'t seem that long at all. Basically, 7 round of more of less 30 minutes, plus explanations for our first game. First round a bit longer, last round a bit quicker.  And I really appreciate that, like in a political race, you can\\'t please every \"state\" and you can move on the current region or any of the next three (up to seven round). Amazing game and I love the Valley Games edition. The perfect electoral game. A fantastic game with a whole lot going on.  A fair bit of luck with the party policy cards that come up, and especially in the first regional election.  But great   game, which I always enjoy. Good game One of the best ever, for hard gamers. Must ... play ... more. The grandfather of Eurogames. Yes....Its amazing and deserves it\\'s high ranking. The bidding can get a bit wonky late in the game, but that\\'s a minor complaint. A very solid game.  The only thing stopping it from getting a 10 is that it takes so long to play. Christmas 06 The rules gave me a headache, but the game is superb! The game involves lots of interactions and negotiations among players.  it would be ever more exciting for different groups of people represent their own \"parties\" in the game. What an awesome and intricate game. Too much . . . but yet, so rich. Everything I want in a game!!Strategy, Bidding and a really exciting final finish.Very heavy gaming :-)Every little thing makes a difference!! Online besteld op 5/08/07. total r0x0r! Heavily procedural yet amazingly immersive in both terms of theme and gameplay. A heavyweight game, but not as long and complex as it first seems. Die Macher is king, or should that be Chancellor?!  when this game is played you have to bring \"IT\" brother.  There\\'s no kiddin around with die macher if you play a game (at least with my group) you are in for a 3 to 4 hour   ride with Dr. Intensity PHD.  We usually play with a loaded gun on the table to add extra emotion.  Seriously, although sometimes sadly luck ridden there really is a magic in this game that sums up the power and the art form of decision making.  5 horas de um jogo sobre política alemã? Sim e é fantástico. Só peca pelos componentes não tanto pela qualidade mas pelo visual. Difícil alcançar os primeiros lugares se você já saiu mal. One of the strongest (and most fun) themes out there! A deep and complex game. I cannot believe that the game is so old, and yet feels so fresh. Great game a big brain burner.. just wish it wasnt so hard to find players for this Prev. Owned -- Hans im Glück (moskito) edition (1986) Played -- Valley Games edition (2006) Really, really want to try this one, and I could even bought it cause the theme is so interesting, how to win at Politics...  Already played it, and now I want more, wonderful game, everything makes sence, even the small things.  It\\'s a Game I will never say no, it takes a little to play (4h30 the only time I played it) but the time flyes and you don\\'t feel it. A Must Play Game.  I think that with more plays my Rating will go up. Reasons why the game is not a straight 10: - card design and iconography. It is not clear and several symbols are very alike. This feature can be easily fixed with a huge redesign. - the last 2 states: no time to react. Many points can fluctuate because of this, you can not influence. - in the national board, the points for the national policies in common with your party policies are too strong. Many points are given away in the last 2 states where you can influence. With a redesign, the game is a solid 9.5 Way ahead of its time. An absolute classic. UGLY board. Horribly complicated rules. Dry theme about German politics. Takes 4-5 hours to play. Requires at least 3 players, so you have to find at least 2 unwilling victims.  GREAT game!! :) Very good game. I like all the decisions both tactical and strategic. Played with 4 & 5. Better with 5. No downtime.  Those graphics on the cards sucks bigtime. Tempted to rate this one slightly lower due to the Comic Sans font and graphic design issues that really kill the graphic design art school soul in me, but it\\'s still the same game that plays out the same way, so it keeps the high mark. Dani: 10 One of the few games with mechanic that struck me like thunderbolt. Played it once and was amazed on how high the interaction is and you can easily immersed in the game play aside the low visual aesthetic. Definitely something that I want to have in my collection, a grail game. I was very excited to play this game and it lived up to the hype.  So much going on and so much looking ahead, while at the same time everything is real confined and you\\'re able to start seeing things happening after about the third round.  Great game...top 3 worthy on my list. Brilliant Don\\'t start this game unless you\\'re ready for it. It\\'s a long trek but never dull. Political alliances will be made and quickly forgotten as the focus turns to the next state. This title offers many choices to boost your position or erode those of your opponents.  传统德式游戏中的标志性游戏，GEEK玩家的必玩之作，游戏除了体验时间较长之外，几乎没有缺点；就桌面游戏这一层面来说，对政党之间纷争带来的拟真程度的尤其值得给满分，游戏中包含各种机制，就目前桌游的发展眼光来看，很难想象出这是一款30年前出版的游戏，如果有幸收得一套，千万别出了，留作珍藏吧；如果有幸能蹭玩一次，千万别犹豫，桌游生涯圆满了。。是的，这是一部里程碑意义的大作，BGG桌游编号NO.1已经证明了其无可替代的价值 【关键词】政治献金，竞选拍卖，发展党员，胜选席位，内阁成员，媒体话语权，党派政策，电话联盟  【推荐度】高 【政治投票，极重度德式爱好者 Own the 2019 Limited edition (Kickstarter) What can I say that hasn\\'t been said already?  Beautiful game, not overly complex game play but the strategies to win certainly are.  I enjoyed the player interaction that this game fostered and the making and breaking of colitions (especially those that were forced) made this game very enjoyable.  The 5hrs that it took to play really flew by.  I am eagerly looking forward to playing this one again and wouldn\\'t turn down the opportunity!!! Time is the only thing that holds me back from this. I absolutely love it. Poli-sci major comes out, but there is so much to do... Excellent game - delivered on the expectations I had from the reviews here on the Geek. I have played it only once but found it to be a very good game. The theme is not for everyone and I have seen many people waving it off in sheer fear due to its \"heavy\" and \"dry\" theme. As usual, if you look behind the theme, the game is a good one, which is not as hard to learn as the legend has it but very hard to master and definitely not for those players who do not like to think ahead. In fact, the crux of the game is that you are pretty much playing four game rounds at the same time, while the first one will be resolved next and so forth. Although I am German, the theme does nothing for me (Elections ? Yawn), but it does not deduce from the fun either and I suppose it is the only theme that works with all the mechanics, knotting them together in context. The theme and lack of randomness makes this a 9 for me and the fact that it rarely sees play pushes it down to 8.5. Nevertheless, a great game indeed !  How, this is great stuff!  Lots of interaction, planning, calculation, bidding, playing with the odds...  The looks are a bit dry, of course, but it´s such a good game...the only major cons are its length (more or less 6 hrs) and its legendary prone to AP, especially in the earlier rounds. However, the game rules are not that heavy, what happens is that there are lots of phases in each round. It deserved to hit more on the mainstream and get out of the mythical limbo where it is now, beeing a little shortened and with an edition of UE parliament. PyP Top 10 Strategy Game. A truly outstanding combination of different gaming mechanisms resulting in an outstanding game, that is surprisingly straightforward after a few playings. The game\\'s length is a possible problem, but during play, tempus fugit! Great game! If only it weren\\'t so long, it\\'d be a perfect 10. And it isn\\'t because I don\\'t like long games, it just makes it harder to get someone to play it. Perfect game. In my top 10. I&#039;m a fan of this game. It takes a bit to get through the first game but after that it&#039;s straight forward. Lots of good decisions to make and forward thinking required. Highly recommended. A fascinating game - lots of stages to the game, and very long (4 to 5 hours)- but it&#039;s one you are bound to enjoy. Very complicated but extremely rewarding. A rich and complicated system makes this game feel like a real election rather than just a game. I can&#039;t think of a single thing wrong with this one except it is on the long side, but any game with deep strategy usually is. I love the way local issues are promoted to national issues... very intriguing. One of the best. Lots of German text in cards can be difficult for some, although they are basic German words. Don&#039;t let the complexity of the rules prevent you from playing this game.  Even when we were playing it wrong, we were loving it.  Fortunately, the bits don&#039;t need translation and are well incoporated.  It&#039;s a superb strategy game which really holds true to its theme. BURNED IN FIRE, OCTOBER 2017 Among the best politically themed games around.  Takes a while to play but is well worth your time. One of the best board games ever. Very elegant collection of mechanics and I really like the theme after all these dragon or reneissance Italy themes. Simply amazing! I bit on the long side and a hard to sell theme, but apart from that: This is The Game! It\\'s got dice, event cards AND long term strategic planning! It\\'s, it\\'s just, just beautiful... *sigh* The ultimate strategy game. There is every kind of mechanism and several different strategies can be applied and these are totally submerged in a political setting that is absolutely fascinating. It\\'s a really old game but it\\'s mechanics totally stand proudly in modern times Ahhh.....a german game that does not end \"just as I\\'m getting warmed up\". A good game for those that don\\'t suffer from gaming A.D.D. My rating on this one goes up the more I play it... each time reveals interactions and implications I didn\\'t notice before.  Highly absorbing and highly recommended. German 2nd Edition (\"The proper one\") Rating based on reputation only as I haven\\'t managed to actually play it yet. Steep learning curve. UPDATE: I\\'ve played it a few times now and it is engrossing. I\\'ve never seen four hours fly by like they did playing this game. The interactions of the various mechanics is great. First edition German edition. Does this really simulate politics? In a right-minded group it\\'s a blast. Excellent game about German elections. Lots of interlocking mechanisms and large amounts of player interaction. So many things to do, with so limited resources. And the time really flies by while you\\'re playing, four hours feel more like one. Highly recommended. Beautiful game reviewed on my blog. What looks to be a dry theme is actually one of the best games to be invented.  It has a play length of 4-6 hours, but our group has played it numerous times which is a testimate to how good it really is.  One of my favorites. No other game has made me say, \"That didn\\'t FEEL like it took four hours.\" Great game! Everyone is involved all the time, lots of choices, plenty of interaction. Need to play games repeatedly to remember it, though. Game 2 was over a year after game 1, and i\\'d totally forgotten the importance of the endgame party scoring - my wife (newbie) kicked all our butts! May go up to a 9, although likely not until I have a good feel for the turn sequence etc (so that the game flows better).  4th edition: There has been a LOT of development to get from the original version to this one! For example, the basic game is now just 4 rounds, there is no national platform to try to match for end-game points, the poll auction is now a simple once-around affair with the most popular player making the last bid (and the poll cards always show 2 +s and 3 -s; if published, may only improve your own trend and must drop both the -s), it’s a lot easier to change your platform (everyone can get 2 free issue swaps — you just need to hope the cards you want are available in the display), there are no coalition-forming negotiations any more (“coalitions” have essentially be stripped out, although they’re still there in name — they’re now mostly just a way for multiple people to get extra VP).  But I’m sort of ambivalent about this. It felt like a lesser game vs. the original, although it’s been quite some time since I played that. On the other hand, the game plays faster (3.5 hrs for us, but likely even faster on repeat plays) and I kind of like the simplifications here. If I hadn’t played the original, I think I would have liked this quite a bit more! It’s probably a great game for modern sensibilities but I think I prefer the original? Need to try it again! How great is this game.  A brain burner extraordinaire.  Never time nor players.. but ... but hope springs eternal... Elegant to an unbelievable degree. Although the theme is obscure the game mechanisms are so well designed and put together that the interaction provides a very satisfying result.  Very meaty, heavy game ripe with compelling decisions that require advance planning. Lots of strategy, lots of bits, lots of things going on to keep track of. A bit overwhelming at first, but once everything starts to \"click\" and you can see the big picture, it\\'s a masterful work of game design. It seems that luck can rear its head and force some players to be little more than spectators toward the end, but more playings will tell for certain. This one seems more complex than it really is. Very little luck involved. A real good game, i like to play it but to find other Player isn\\'t so easy, but if you get other Player for a play you will get 5 houres of great playtime!!!  Eddie\\'s Comments: Rating is based on one game; however, i came to this rating AFTER the rules explanation (which took about 1.5 hours) and before playing the game. Playing the actual game only finalized my rating. There is alot going on but if you have the right people playing (which I did) it is a very enjoyable experience. The best \\'long\\' game I have played.  Very deep, it makes your head spin :)   Definitely a gamer\\'s game. Everything that happens affects everything else, so there are loads of considerations for every decision.  I recommend this very highly for anyone wishing to spend 6 hours of mind-bending exercise that will leave you satisfied and wanting to play it again. Very good interaction and not a lot of downtime, which you otherwise would have thought about a four hours game.  Wow! This is one of my top ten games if played by people who have played before and know the rules. Preliminary rating after one play. It IS as good as everyone says! A classic game of earning money and points using many different mechanisms that all interact in interesting ways. There does seem to be many paths to victory and its a bit more subtle that just earning influence in a few areas. Its also quite satirically funny! Playing time\\'s not too bad either with the right crowd (4 hours?). How to describe \"Die Macher\" to the uninitiated? Well, imagine a game that makes even non-Germans develop a keen interest in the otherwise extremely boring German election system - people who hate statistics and percentages suddenly strive for parties they have never heard of in their life. The game is a realistic simulation on one hand, a superb puzzle for gamer geeks on the other hand. Although completely abstract it is a totally engrossing, if not a little abstract game. Let the \"spin doctors\" (a rough English translation of \"Macher\") rule forever! There are so many ways to go at it and lots to ponder, but yet the game can move along nicely.  I\\'m looking forward to playing this one again.   This might rate a 10 if I got to play more but the fact that it is so hard for me to get a game together probably means this will never be a 10 anyway.  A few thoughts: 1.  The rules and gameplay are not as complex or weighty as some would have you fear (I highly recommend the excellent turn by turn player aid here... though you should read through that before playing as you will see things such as the differences that take place for the 7th election.) 2.  You don\\'t need to know any German (again, player aids will solve this problem... plus everything uses symbols.) 3.  The game will fly by if everyone is paying attention - there is very, very little downtime.  If I were forced to get rid of all of my games but one, I think this would be the one I would keep. German elections have never been so much fun.  If only it was a bit shorter it would be on the table all the time. One of the truly great German board games: a multi-faceted game of elections and political party competition. Great interlocking systems where one decision has ramifications for all the others. Brilliant design. Only negatives: it takes a while to learn the rules and it\\'s a bit on the longish side (four hours or so). It almost never seems to find the table any more, which is a shame. Great game, the complexity makes me squirm what to do while not feeling played by the game.   Bumped it up a notch now that 1) I\\'ve finally got the rules down, 2) I\\'ve had a chance to play it with 5.  Simply one of the best games EVAR!  Edit: take 1.5 points off for the terrible graphics on the Valley Games version, if that\\'s all you have.  Several issues have extremely similar art, which can screw you pretty badly. I love the Moskito Edition. Wonderful game. Thanks to 3rd edition for the 5 turn game - a nice way to get to play a much shorter game. this is a classic..no more need be said Truly an exceptional and fascinating game.  It does have a 2-3 turn learning curve (at least for me it did), but thankfully you are not out of the game at that time.  The theme is excellent and integrates well into the game with the national election carrying significant weight at the end.  There is a lot going on here, and I would classify it as a very meaty game - definitely for experienced gamers only as a game can easily go for more than 5 hours.  Negatives are game length - it\\'s hard to find people who are willing to sit down for one game this long, and second, fiddly rules.  And because I don\\'t see this game being played often, constant reference back to the rulebook may be the norm.  Overall though, great game!  If you consider yourself a gamer, you owe it to yourself to give this game a try. Great game with 5, decent with 4.  Wish I had more time to play it.  With our group, it runs 6 hours. Americans seem to be more interested in German politics than we are ourselves as judged from the time it took me to find players willing to try this one with me. But now I did and I agree: This is a great game. Being German I might be biased, but it just is so much fun to let the Greens support genetic engineering, hehehe. A long, but engrossing game. So many decisions, so little time & resources! A classic. I thought about this game for days after my first playing.  This was my first overseas gaming purchase, and pulling it out of its shrinkwrap was nearly a religious experience.  I can\\'t wait to introduce it to my gaming group. If only everyone could see the greatness of this game.... But sadly most of my friends don\\'t, so i rarely get to play this one. After a few games I am convinced that this is a masterpiece. Die Macher is likely to rise to number ten gategory eventually. Best Longer game ever! (4 hours). The time flys, all the mechanics are clever and interesting and engaging. The playing time makes it a hard sell to hit the table a lot, but when it does it\\'s among the best ganing expiriences. Just one game of this so far but it seems fantastic. Lots of different strategies and options. Long though. Fantastic theme, brilliant mechanics, looks great. Makes four hours feel like one with minimal downtime. I own the first and second editions.  I\\'ve had to drop it from a 10 to a 9 because I haven\\'t played it in so long. If I loved it to a 10 level then I would have fought to play it again by now. Insert personal observation of this quality game here. Brilliant game, way ahead of its time... the first time you get screwed by a coalition will be one you will never forget.  It really is a thing of beauty. Everything flows cleanly and smoothly, all the mechanics make sense, they all interact well with each other, and deliver a delightfully subtle and balanced game that can and does regularly produce ticklishly evil moments of pure gaming joy.  Very few euros can touch Die Macher in terms of its combination of strategic depth, tactical options, theme, game balance, and subtlety. Not to mention voting on square tomatoes. I mean, who doesn\\'t love - or hate! - square tomatoes? Very deep and heavy, only for hardcore gamers. An outstanding game!! However, a very long game... [Planning, Resource Management, Negotiation, Bidding, Political] [4P:9, 5P:9] *** Preliminary rating. Definite \\'10\\' potential, but it\\'ll take a while and certainly a few more plays. Favorable comparisons from my gaming buddies to PR and PoF, from both a mechanism and stylistic standpoint. I have a better one. Macher\\'s nature and rhythm, among all the games I\\'ve played, is closest to Kramer & Kiesling\\'s Maharaja. You\\'re planning and executing 4 elections simultaneously, and trying your darndest to insulate yourself from the inherent chaos of the game system while keeping your timing and resources as straight as possible. You\\'re trying to make sure that you get close to your desired result in every region that matters, whether or not someone whacks you with a bad opinion poll when that region becomes current. (Or outright insulating yourself with media control, which is expensive to set up, but even more expensive for your opponents to undo when they choose to.) I would equate this to being able to do what you plan to do in Maharaja regardless of what hijinks people pull with your character card and the governor track. What Macher has over Maharaja is many, many more paths to victory at the cost of a significantly higher fiddle factor. However, given the theme the whole thing works, and in a surprisingly elegant manner despite all the moving parts.    In short, I (or should I say we) like it a lot, and I can see us polishing off a full game in 3-4 hours once we have the whole thing down and can take turns rapidly a-la Goa at full throttle. Clearly an \"only game of the night\" situation, but that was how it was when we first started playing 5P PR years ago (we were averaging 3.5 hours a game early on, and we still take 2.5 hours today).   The only trouble we had rules-wise was with the exchange pool. Playing it with Schmeil\\'s \"flood the pool\" rules was rather counterintuitive, but in the end I guess it follows theme-wise since issues do get more muddled as elections get close to climax.   *** #1 Most Wanted Game. Rabidly recommended by my Geekbuddies - 8.39(!) rating, 18 ratings, rated only behind Puerto Rico, The Princes of Florence and Euphrat & Tigris. Now that\\'s a foolproof recommendation. At long last, I got to play this, and it\\'s as good as the first game on the Geek should be. The rules are a bit unclear, however, and we\\'ve played at least one rule  wrong (discard or replacement pool for opinion cards). Great game in spite of its length. Played twice. I really dig this game.  Again, just need to find others who share the burning desire to bring their Political Party from a foriegn country into power. This is a fun, if long, game. One of the reasons I like it is because it is hard to be a king maker because unless you are constantly updating the scores it is hard to figure out who exactly is in the lead. This is a great game -- the theme essential to the mechanics, the different systems in the game are extremely well integrated, and it\\'s fun to play.  It does take a while to play, but it\\'s really not as heavy as it\\'s made out to be. Introducing this behometh can be a stumbling block however I have found referring people to Scott Nicholsons video intro of it has helped significantly.  This is a VERY fun game that I have now played several times and would still love to get it to the table more often, it is just difficult to do due to the time commitment.  It is referred to as a classic and I am glad to have found it. Wow. I don\\'t think there\\'s much I can say that hasn\\'t already been said about this game other than I love it! Just wish Valley Games had made some better choices in terms of graphic design but it is their first go at this.  UPDATE: I\\'ve noticed a lot of newer players asking lately whether this game is best with 3, 4, or 5 players. Some have answered that it\\'s better with 4 or 5 players due to the emphasis that having more players has on coalitions. Having now played one 3 player game and one 4 player game, I\\'d actually suggest new players start with 3 players. The reason is that new players will be busy enough learning how the game works and what the relative importance of each mechanic is that they won\\'t be able to use coalitions to much effect anyways. Furthermore, a game with 3 players will simplify the board, making it easier to analyze and allowing the game to move more quickly.  Even among more experienced players, I\\'d guess coalitions are not that easy to form and they don\\'t seem to impact a given round *that* much anyways. There is a lot of player interaction in this game but this isn\\'t a diplomacy game. Die Macher seems to do well with any number of players and I suspect that doesn\\'t change even as players gain more experience. When you have the time to spare, it just doesn\\'t get much better than this.  High player interaction, seven different resources to manage and juggle, always trying to stay one step ahead of the opposing parties, and lots of out-guessing and second-guessing. I love being a politician, even if only for 5 hours... Totally unique experience.  Yeah, it\\'s long.   But there\\'s lots going on and plenty to do.  Weird theme, too, but it works.  Unlike any other game I\\'ve ever played.  Interaction level is quite high.   There are some surprisingly random elements too, but they don\\'t really ruin anything for me.   There\\'s just nothing you can compare this to, it stands on its own. Played once and loved it.  Can\\'t wait to try again. - Cartas enfundadas con ayudas visuales de colores [b]Design:- [/b]:star::star::star::star::star:  [i]A tight, flawless, framework fitting seamlessly with the political theme.[/i] [b]Execution:- [/b]:star::star::star::star::nostar:  [i][/i]  [b]Experience:- [/b]:star::star::star::star::star:  [i][/i] [b]Presentation:- [/b]:star::star::star::nostar::nostar:  [i]The Valley Games version I own falls down on card quality and artwork; some cards are difficult to distinguish, all cards have been poorly cut, making stacking, handling and shuffling a bit of a chore.[/i]  A real gamer\\'s game which deserves one\\'s full attention.  I can see playing time becoming greatly reduced in this game after everybody knows what is going on; the big problem is getting the group to sit through the first long game or two while they learn the ropes. Fantastic. Whoever thought German politics can be so fun?!!  This game has an incredible amount of excruciating long and short term decisions.  Get caught up thinking too much is important, or the wrong thing, or oppose the groupthink on the issues for too long, and the game gets away from you.  The polls can be volatile or nearly useless, making them dangerous to ignore and dangerous to overspend on.  A handful or two of mechanics lumped into one very enjoyable and deep game.  Five player game took about 4.5 hours (after rules explanation with 4 new players), four player took 3.5. The definite game experience. Valley Games edition. Complete. Cards are in deck boxes. (I don\\'t remember if it came with a box insert or not, but there isn\\'t one now.) Cubes and tokens are sorted and bagged. The box has a 1 cm slice into the paper one edge of the box top. The slice is not through the cardboard. There is a small dent in one cornet of the box top. It is barely noticable, but it is there. Great 6 hour brain burn. yes! Die Macher is one of the very few long games that I\\'d like to play on any given opportunity, and I was hugely impressed by its design since my first play. It\\'s long, but it\\'s complex, not complicated: there are different rule systems mixed together to portray different aspects of your political campaign, but each of them is simple to understand and to manipulate during the game.  Mastering the whole system takes time, of course, but you\\'ll find yourself grasping its main dynamics much sooner than you\\'d expect, probably just after you\\'ve gone through the first round of play. So, don\\'t let its fame scare you: our first game was with two non-gamers, and they both really enjoyed it. The system is streamlined and functional, the theme is well implemented and you can easily imagine your party going through all the vicissitudes of a political campaign.  Give it a try if you can :) Finally played. A really good game with few flaws (the biggest flaw being \"too easy to get 50  votes\") While the game had a bit outdated mechanics and general sweet clumsiness it also had an aura of charm and a lot of heart in it. I expected a lot and solid \"9\" I gave feels like a bit disappointment. Definitely gets more play time in our group. So\\xa0much going on! Although a long game time-wise, the game itself passes quickly because I am always watching and reacting. Lives up to my expectations. Finally got to play this game.  It has unseated Puerto Rico as my favorite game officially...that is if I were forced to say I had a favorite.  This game is simply just as amazing as everyone says.  Long? Yes. Worth it? HELL Yes! Won\\'t see as many plays as PR due to the length but any game that I\\'m still thinking about several weeks later...WOW!  UPDATE had more games played now.  Just a fine fine game.  I\\'m in Awe of this game.  Maybe should be a ten but I am not quite sure Im ready to put it there. Just too tough to get to the table. - - Finally played once.  I will definitely be playing at least once over summer vacation, maybe twice more.  This game is DEEP.  It\\'s a brain drain of the most fun kind.  But German politics. . .still scary.  After 5 games, it seems that the praise this game gets is well earned.  Now that I know the rules well, it plays faster (2.5 - 3 hours).  It\\'s long, but worth the effort.  The rules (in every form I\\'ve seen them) are fairly poorly written, but FAQ\\'s are helpful. Excellent and well balanced mix of many mechanism. If it was just a bit shorter (3 hours instead of 4), I would rate it a 9 or even a 10.  In Die Macher (\"The Election\"), players represent 1 of 5 politcal parties in Germany and try to win votes and influence national opinions over the course of 7 state elections. The primary way of gaining votes in a state is to match your party platform (consisting of 5 cards which define your party\\'s ideas about diverse subjects such as genetic engineering, nuclear power, anti-terrorism spending, social security and so on) with the public opinions of the election state (consisting of 4 cards that equally define that state\\'s opinions on similar topics). Each match is a positive multiplier for votes and each opposite match is a negative multiplier. Through the use of media, shadow cabinet members, and the results of opinion polls, public opinion of your party can also lead to positive and negative multipliers. There are also limited opportunities to change your party\\'s platform to suite the state up for election (heh, heh) and through control of the media change one of the states\\' opinions on a topic to better suite your party\\'s. Add to this a strong economic element, where money is used to buy media influence, to organize meetings to get out the votes, and to purchase the right to release or bury opinion polls if help or hurt your party. And not only are you doing all of this for the current state under election, but you can also begin to influence elections up to three states ahead of the current election. While all of this is going on, you are also working to expand your party membership and, by winning state elections, help to define national opinions that will give you big end-game scoring bonuses if national opinions closely match your party platform.  Whew. This a lot of stuff to juggle. The game turns consist of about 14 steps that happen in the same order for each election. The processional mechanics keep each step distinct and prevent the game from sinking into a morass of complexity. I think having a casual gamer play with us was a good gauge for how approachable this game is and she claimed to have a good time with it. I cannot think of any individual step or mechanic in the game that felt out of place or that could be improved. I\\'m scoring this a 9 for now, but after another play or two this could become one of my coveted 10\\'s. If only it were easier to get to the table.... Excellent game, probably my favorite game i\\'ve played so far.  It is pretty complex the first time you play but once you go through a round or two you get a good hang for it.  Requires a lot of planning and strategy to maintain popularity in all regions Finally played this classic and WOW!  Has lots of different mechanics and things going on, but after 1 or 2 elections, you figure it out!  The only downside is the time (4 hours for our 5 players - 2 being new to the game).  I now think I have the mechanics down after a game (yes they are that easy), but figuring out a strategy is totally different (even though I came in 2nd). Can\\'t wait to play again!   Perhaps one of the ultimate games of our times.  The rules take awhile to explain, but everything makes some sort of sense in the end.  Have to play with the play aids, but the game is a blast. I can\\'t think of any political games better than this out there. Check out my review here:  http://mike-compton.blogspot.com/2007/06/review-die-macher.html Ahhh, I finally got to try the fabled Die Macher.  It more than lived up to all the hype for four engrossing hours.  Could end anywhere from an 8 to a 10 upon further playings, which I hope will be soon. Update:  As much as I enjoy it, there is a bit too much luck and randomness for such a long game.  Also, the new version has cards that are susprisingly hard to distinguish.  I much prefer the original.  I do thoroughly enjoy it and wouldn\\'t turn down a game (as long as I had a few free hours!) Played this for the first time with four players. We all came away really loving it. Although it has a long game length, it does not feel like it. I really lover the way your involved and interacting throughout the entire game. big, big thumbs up !!!!  The game really holds your interest from start to finish. Epic. A great game that really makes you think, and fascinatingly true to its rather strange theme. Its procedural nature makes it rather easy to teach, but still has enough complexity to be far from trivial to master. A fault (for Valley Games edition, at least): The cards are *very* difficult to tell apart - not only across the table, but even in your own hand. long, but always very engaging There will probably never be a better game of politics ever made.  I love this game.  I gripe about how influential the polls are in the game - they can really spoil it sometimes - but I still love it.  For years, this was the only game I thought of when thinking of playing a game on my birthday. A totally engaging experience.  Yeah, it\\'s 4 hours, but you leave the table feeling you\\'ve really gone through a world. Excellent and fascinating game. The only drawback is that you need 1 hour to explain to someone how it plays. If the players know the game, it takes about 3 hours per game (5-players) and you want to play again. It is the most well interconnected game that I have ever played. Everything you do has an impact. No downtime. Amazing game! But it can very long with new players. A pretty heavy game, but with lots of different strategies and twists. Elegant Masterpiece. Though I will will not \"always suggest it\" due to duration, I envision myself playing several games a year for the rest of my life.  My only downturn is that the graphic design leaves much to be desired; my campaign platform supports a Mike Doyle edition. Finally got a chance to play this and boy am I glad I kept this game.  Totally engrossing and a ton of depth, now I just need to figure out how to introduce it to more players! I now understand why this is described as the greatest euro..............4 and a half hours of intense activity with no downtime and every decision an agony of possibilities! FANTASTIC! Really Great to understand the works of party Democracies in the modern world and with a great deal of flexibility. Awesome.  Valley Games Edition: German rulebook has some translation faults. Rulebook in general could be more detailed in explaining the different phases of a single round. Anyway, Die Macher is still a boardgame classic for gamers who like the heavier Euro games. It takes a few games to get all the mechanics and to know how it all works together. No play and love at first sight but brilliant after a few games. I\\'ve finally gotten to play this after years of coveting it; it\\'s fantastic. It\\'s among the best Euro games I\\'ve ever played. There are so many interlocking mechanisms!   You must look ahead while you worry about the current election; you can\\'t win them all so you have to gauge your fights and plan your future battleground states. I think it\\'s a brilliant design.  I fully confess that I don\\'t really know what I\\'m doing or how to evaluate properly on the whole, but I got stronger at the end of our game.   This game may be the best \\'heavy\\' game I\\'ve played in the Euro/Designer vein and one of the best I\\'ve played in a very long time; it is in no way appropriate for most tables/groups. It is most assuredly not for almost any family or casual gamer. That said, I think you could get people to play it if you got them through a game or two.   It really does play smoothly and if you get the election scoring formula down--and have a good turn explaining player aid (as found on the \\'Geek)--it\\'s very easy to play.  I am amazed at the design of this game; the abstraction of a political system, the interlocking of mechanics, the smooth play (once you get the basics down this thing moves), and the speed of time that flew by once we got it rolling: 3 hours went by unnoticed for me. Just, \"Wow.\"  The explanation of the game was thorough, but made the game seem way more complex than the playing of it was. This is just a massive success of design and a game I will own (even if it never sees the table).  Truly fantastic.  Rating this will be hard for me...it\\'s a 10 in design, but it\\'s not one I would want to play endlessly or at every session (no game is yet)...I always struggle with these kinds of games in ratings... Valley Games edition. Cunning and strategic. Take returns now or invest in the future. Can you afford to abandon this electerate? Have only played this behemoth once, but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I\\'m looking forward to playing my new Valley Games copy. I am not sure if I\\'d rate it a 9 but I do \"Always want to play it\" currently... Update: The Valley Games edition is hideous.  Two issue cards are largely indistinguishable from other for a lot of people.  That said, the game is still riveting nonetheless. First off, this game is long.  Like, you can watch 2 movies and still have time to get in a game of Modern Art long.  But it really doesn\\'t feel as bad as some medium weight games that start pushing the 2 hour mark.  The game itself is amazing.  I\\'ve never played anything like it and all the mechanics were elegant.  The one thing that surprised me was the luck element.  Opinion poll cards can mean the difference between gaining 50 VPs on an opponent or staring at a bad die roll and wondering why you bothered bidding on the card in the first place.  The program cards also add to this if you are continually drawing duplicate or useless cards.  The amount of information available seems to cross the line from something to work with in your mind to the inevitable cause of AP, and this can\\'t really be helped in a game like this.  However, it still detracts from the overall experience.  Having said all of that, if you can overlook the above, the rest of the game is phenomenal and well worth the time investment. After playing this game a few times, I am bumping up the rating.  A fine game, the option where national board replacements go the right rather than the left is a must. only played once... wish it was more! Mind-blowing goodness.  Chaotic and exhilarating.  The rules aren\\'t difficult at all to pick up, they\\'re just very procedural. Definitely the deepest and most fulfilling Euro around. Will continue to play this for as long as my brain allows me to. Played my first game (FINALLY).  One of the best games I\\'ve played.  Very balanced, and very easy to deconstruct a game when complete to figure out where your good and bad mover were.  I was concerned that it was over hyped...it was not. this game was everything that i wanted it to be after finally playing the first time. i think it\\'ll be a great one for the gaming group. I had high expectations before I played this classic, but Die Macher met and exceeded them.  I enjoyed the tension of balancing media, party meetings, and opinions.  I liked the significant but not overwhelming screwage factor, which I had not expected.  Sinking someone\\'s heavy investment in a state election with shadow cabinet members or polls can be a vicious but effective tactic.  The components in the German edition were functional but complemented the theme efficently and aesthetically.        Excellent game on the political election process in Germany.  Long, but worth the effort.  I have two copies of this game. Stunning game themed on German elections.  Each player plays a political party and must guide their way through a series of seven elections.  Simple mechanics interact in complex ways, as players juggle party meetings, media, cash all in the quest for votes.  The result is wonderful.  Easily in my top five games of all time.  It will take four hours, but will seem like only two hours.  November 2006 - just played a friend\\'s Valley Games edition - muddy and confusing graphics on the cards (two of the issues look identical from outside a foot away), however the game plays almost the same (a few odd rules differences).  Hans im Glueck/Moskito edition is much cleaner and easier on the eyes. [i][Comment is for 2nd edition from Moskito. The new one is crap][/i]  Definitely a keeper. I played my first game yesterday and I won by a margin of 1 point! I still have to figure out the different strategies that will lead to victory. Will be able to evaluate further after more playing, but I definitely want to play again as soon as possible. I think I got hooked!  Update: After having it played 3 times, I upped this game from 8 to 10. It is simply excellent.  Update: After 11 years, I am moving this from a 10 -> 9. While still one of my favorite games, I may have \\'Machered-out\\' a bit. Playing it once a year is typically enough for me these days. I felt really thrilled after the first couple of games. Now feels a bit stale. +++ 40 € Oh, wow, this one is special. Last played : Sept 2007 Ich bin DER MACHER!!!  First play for all five of us clocked in at 5 1/2 hours - pretty much right on target.  Kind of a brain burner, but I think all of us enjoyed it quite a lot.  I know I did, but then a win at first play always gives one a good impression of a game.  Little down time, since all are involved in every aspect of each round. Thanks Ken, Gail, Brian and Alan!  01/05/08 New in shrink wrap. What? 5 hours of German politics? Is this a joke right??   Not a game for everyone, but I believe a gamers experience isn\\'t complete without playing this monster.  Great theme! The mechanics of the game couldn\\'t be more appropriated. A rocky 10!!  Intrigin game, tension can be high in thight votes. very good game. Components: if you have the Moskito edition, they are good Complex: hard to master, difficult to learn Weight: Heavy Players: 5 Length: around 4 hours Mechanics: bidding, area control... Decisions: really a lot Opinion: it is always a pleasure to play a game of Die Macher, although the theme is one to run away from it, the gameplay is delicious. Master your political party to win the elections... but you have to decide which of the 7 Ländern to go for, keeping an eye on the National board. I would say that the rules are not hard to learn, but there are so many that make them difficult. Once you start playing, everything is very well connected, and that is make the game much easy to understand. You would play 6 rounds (the last one is just played after the 6th) for one Länder each one, but you can prepare your future situation. Prepare the politics of your party versus the one of the current Länder, taking care of the National board for game end, decide if you need money from private donations, bid for different surveys (not only for helping you, but also for avoiding they mess your plans) and go for votes on the different elections. Although the length of the game is around 4 hours, they pass really fast. There is no time between turns, each round has lot of phases, and they go very fast making all players being participating all the time. I could be talking good things about the game for long time, I would finish just saying that is one of my favorite games, a pleasure to play whenever I have the occasion and would look for plays as soon as I could This game is awesome.  It has all the stuff that I love about games.  Long term planning, difficult decisions, short term survival, and a great theme.  Some people think german politics is a dry theme but to me all politics is interchangable regardless of where it is located as far as money, media, and party policies.  It\\'s a very fun political game and I have to say that its quickley becoming one of my favorites.   Maybe one of the smartest games I\\'ve played.   My first play resulted in a win for me that was mostly blind luck on my part as I was counter to the issues all game until the final election, which I won and was able to change the national opinion to my favor...  so needless to say, I had a favorable reaction.  Since then I have lost one game by a large margin and still think it is a superior design.    I would gladly rate this a 10 if not for the terrible graphics used on the Valley Games ed.   No offense to them, but the generic looking digital art is way to small and entirely too difficult to see across the table. After a whole game I decided to update my review to \\'9\\'. Great game. Great game but long, and that seems to work against it as most folks cant commit to a 4-6 hour game- so it doesnt get played often enough. However, I love it and find that with the right 5 players (why bother playing with less than that really), it is a total blast. I don\\'t enjoy too much in the way of table talk and while I DO believe that some deal making is to be made. I dont believe that other parties should influence another parties decision against anouther party UNLESS they are going to be in a coalition in the current states election. Just my bit.  GREAT STUFF The rules are exemplary, and the game example brilliant to understand the rules - if you read German. I have the Valley Games 3rd edition as well, A true classic, it\\'s only flaw may be the play time of 5-6 hours.  However there\\'s NO downtime in there, it\\'s a roller coaster all the way. Great political game.  Very original concept. Mechanistically great game but for some reason just does not really grab me 100%. Need to play again though. Always enjoyable when we can get enough experienced players. Fantastic, complicated game that\\'s not TOO overdesigned.  I elect it a good game. This is truly a great game that has stood the test of time.  There is a lot going on in this game--and that, unfortunately, is one of its shortcomings.  There is almost too much going on and the game seems more like a process than a game.  I would rate this game even higher if the time involved to play one game was reduced dramatically.  If you want a solid game \"simulating\" politics, opinion polls, elections and policy, then this is THE game.    Awards: Counter Magazine Hall of Fame (1998); Essener Feder (1998).  Highest BGG Rank: #1 (2010)*  * Based on April Fools\\' ranking games by entry into database Wow, great game. There is so much going on your head explodes if you try to keep track of it all. You must develop a \"feel\" and go with your guesstimates, which is what I like about games. Beautifully done. just awesome.... Great Game,  It sure didn\\'t feel like four hours.  I loved the constant decision making and having to look ahead. I had a slow start but once I figured it out I didn\\'t do to bad.  Looking forward to future plays depsite the length required.   What I do love about it: It\\'s kind of sarcastic or at least ironic, how you bend and twist your party\\'s programm so that it adapts to what the people want. You\\'re not in any way trying to make it look like that you\\'re interested in anything else then getting as much votes as possble. The game is so earnest about that, it\\'s actually frightening! I really enjoyed my one play of the game.  I\\'d love to try this again!!  2nd play on 1/28/08:  I *really* like this game.  I hope to play it again soon so I don\\'t need so much of a rules refresher!  Oh, and I finally opened my Valley Games edition of this and MAN the graphics on the cards for the issues are NOT good.  It\\'s really hard to tell a few of them apart. A little long to me, but very much worth playing the whole time!  Great game and love the mechanics.  Reason it is a 9 is the end game part of it.  Whoever gets the last region seems to have too much sway over the points at the end.  Just what I think. Just played this for the first time 2/9, 3 player game. Hope to play more with greater number of players soon. Lives up to the hype, worth the time investment! So much going on at once, nearly impossible to wrap your head around. Love it.  Fantastic game.  There is so much going on yet it still feels balanced and engaging.  This is one of those games that to me has a bit of a steep learning curve, it can be overwhelming to a new player BUT it is so worthwhile to learn it.   I can see myself playing this one any time I can talk anyone into it. The greatest hurdle is summoning the courage to play for the first time. Not a game that can be grokked until after the first play through. A key strength is the limited scope for negotiation, in spite of the political theme. I finally got to play this in February, 2008.  I was too busy getting down the rules to really understand how to affect any meaningful positive changes in my game situation, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. My wife\\'s favourite game. It´s a huge complex heavy game, a gamers game. This game have so many ways to achieve victory. The long version is better than the five round variant, you only know the last round in the fifth end region and that adds a major surprise factor. It\\'s a bit difficult to teach, but not very hard to play after master the rules. My top hot 10 for now. I want to play it all the time. It\\'s a little difficult to find players, because it plays for 4 hours long. Many say that don\\'t play well with 3 players, but i like it a lot. It becomes a bit out of balance during the coalitions, because when that appends one player must run the elections alone. Another reason for the 3 players game must go all the way, 7 elections. But with 3 players with some experience it\\'s possible end that game in less then 3, 30\\'  hours. And the time as passed without you can notice.  15/03/08 - Another excellent session. Great game, one of the best. In the end of 4 coalitions and 4 hours of game, a difference of only 4 points was between the 3 first players. I\\'m really looking forward to playing this!  Well, after one play it has alot going for it but I dont think we got it right (some rules mix ups and with 3, it wasnt quite balanced as one player utterally wiped the floor with us all) Egads! The kitchen sink of games!  The high rating is probably due to the German version having been rare and hard to find making the audience a self selecting one, but the game is still very fun. I prefer the original Hans im Gluck 2nd edition to the Valley Games edition for ease of use and the way the political issue cards are handled.  Thanks Peter and Heather for borrowing this, printing off the player aids, and teaching!! Played half a game once--- I loved it, but others lost interest. I can imagine no circumstances where I will ever get to play this again. I think the only word for it is: Deep. There is a whole lot too this game and the way it twists and intertwines is almost mind-boggling. It could take me a long time to get the hang of it.  Well, my initial thoughts seem to have been born out. I\\'ve placed last in my first three games, though my score is steadily increasing.  This game is on my \\'To Review List\\'. Watch this space. Under-rated probably because of its German political theme but a really great strategic game. Epic \"experience\" game that every serious gamer should try at least once. Shines with 5 and given the investment of time I will not play it with less. I\\'ve only played it once, but I absolutely love it and would jump at another chance to go at it.  Unfortunately it\\'s way long... Someday... Outstanding game. A long game and you af inviolved all the time. Actually I\\'ve only played i once(exsl a get to learn die marcher play), but 10 is the only I can rate. We were all involved all the time and thou it lasted for around 5 hours it didn\\'t seem so long a game. Might be my best gameexperience of all time. [microbadge=5]  An election game, perfectly realized.  Much of it is a math problem, but at the same time, all of it is intuitive.  Some people don\\'t like the opinion polls, but I think they were handled very well; perhaps too true to theme for some to have comfort. The reputation is well-deserved. Only played once (with 3), but I can see it being even better with more.  I can\\'t recommend the demo on \"Boardgames with Scott\" highly enough. Should be required viewing for your playgroup before putting it on the table! Raised my rating of this game to a 9 after playing it again recently. This is simply an amazing game. Excellent and deep game. Takes about 5 hours to play, meaning it\\'s not something that will hit the table often. Very unique game. Tricky to learn because it is so different. Not too difficult to play once you learn it. Tons of replayability. Great, great, great.  I\\'m inclined to agree with those who say this game is actually much lighter than its reputation.  So then, how can it justify it\\'s length?  With theme.  Theme is what encourages length, and this game feels right at every moment and absorbs you in.  Frankly, a long game full of brain-crushing decisions is beyond the means of most anyway, except for the hardiest of the 18xx crowd.  This is a game with an awesome scope, such that is missing from most contemporary game design.  So many different mechanisms live inside this box, and they\\'ve been arranged together in a really cohesive way.  If you\\'re not playing this game with threats, cajoling, pleading, and angry recrimination, I suspect you are doing it wrong.  Beautiful, original graphic design too, assuming you have the HiG version - WHICH I DO.  Amazing atmosphere! A lot of tension! King of eurogames. Takes a bit too long but time passes rather unnoticed! Classic game of German politics. It\\'s better to have someone familiar with the rules to keep the game going. [b]Primera partida[/b] (9/10) Intenso clásico recuperado I hate politic but I love games! This game made me love politic!  From the starters, it sounded so much like a game for me. When actually tried playing I was so lost for a long, long time. But when I started to grasp how it works got really exited again. Have to give it a few more tries, though. I don\\'t understand why I like it so much. This game is stupid... yet I always want to play again.  This game seems to be always at the back of my mind.  The manipulation and quiet scheming is fantastic.  You never really know who is going to win, and decisions are critical often until the end. I love it, I need to play it some more, though 5 people and many hours is hard to arrange.  I want more. Heavy euro about German election, blahblahblah....  Very heavy on the strategy.  Lighter on the tactics.  Die Macher boils down to a game about resource management and subtly managing the state of the game board in your favor.  The game takes place over seven elections, wherein the current and upcoming elections can be manipulated in various ways, and votes can be acquired in various ways.  There are so many ways to score points in this game that it can be maddening, but this keeps AP in check.  There\\'s a different ebb and flow for each player as they focus more or less in different elections.  Heavily contested elections in 5 player games can be very tense, with tons of negotiation over who is going to form a coalition with who (Forced coalitions can be particularly tense, particularly if a player wants to be in a coalition with a different player).  The entire game is a roller coaster from start to finish, and has had a very close ending every single time I have played.   In Die Macher, you\\'re scheming, planning, and thinking ahead so much that the time flies by.    There\\'s one downside; there are some dice that are rolled a few times for each player during a game.  A series of bad rolls can make things very hard on someone.  The art is also too ambiguous and confusing, and while the game plays OK with less than five people, it could use alternate sets of poll cards designed for 4 player (and 3 player) games. A long game that is fairly immersive thematically and the time just flies.  I love me some German politics.  I\\'m not sure what edition we play with but it is German language.  I\\'m holding out for one of those over the Valley Games edition. Great game.  A little long, but it doesn\\'t feel that long to me.  I\\'m still a little hazy on a couple of the rules b/c of the slight changes between editions.  Can\\'t wait to play again.  Acquired 2009-04-17  I\\'ll play this anytime, with great pleasure. Very deep strategic game, just like I like them. My only qualm is that the different phases don\\'t flow naturally, it takes several plays before \"getting it\". HiG Edition for 5-Players Every time we play this we slip into German accents and there is a ton of table talk.  Afterwards we ask why we only play this once or twice a year.  Great game. The rules were explained the previous night and I\\'d borrowed the rulebook - picking up a few mistakes or ommisions on Ian\\'s part.  I fared well in the first few elections but by the 5th was in 2nd last place in total seats so far.  The game ended with me screwing Ian - maybe taking him from 1st to 3rd (me in 2nd) much to his annoyance.  I felt the game was far more enjoyable because I had been already taught the rules and I was able to come into the game with some idea of strategies - namely what I select and holding back my cabinet for a rush in the end.  2 auctions for the last 2 poll results both ended disastrously - 2 other players having a few more units than my 134k ensuring I got neither. Luckily, I wasn\\'t able to be screwed on either place and got 2nd.  There\\'s a definite element of luck - in the dice, in the hidden information of the public opinion (or the public opinion itself) and in the polls - but it never feels absurdly swingy and the game seems to be about managing the chaos as well as you can.  The progressively fewer revealed cards for future elections makes for an elegant demonstration of how we know less about the more distant future. Heavy political themed game. Only a few games behind me, but it\\'s an excellent game. Needs more plays. rating after one play Fiddly and involved, but a fun game that I found has enough to keep it interesting.  Suggest a quick read through of the rules, a learn-it play, and then a more detailed read of the rules to fully understand how the game works. It\\'s got such a terrifiying reputation, but, really, it\\'s not too complex, and it\\'s a rich, interesting game. VG version has nice, solid components (tho\\', as others have noted, the icons can be easily confused--a player aid from BGG will help). Don\\'t be afraid of it--it\\'s a good, solid 2.5h game when played in the shorter, 5-round version. great game. really is an intense game and not difficult to learn. perhaps difficult to learn to play well I don\\'t own it, but have ready access to it, so have listed it as \"owned\".  If anyone in Central London wants a game, am more than happy to bring it along to London on Board (with a week\\'s notice) Classic strategic game, perfect steps for playing Finally played this, over three years after buying.  It is very good indeed.  It would be a possible 10 except for: 1) very long playing time (although the time is worth it). 2)quite daunting learning curve for the first game. 3) the appalling design of the Valley Games cards - a printing error which would have made a key rule inoperable (if not for BGG to clarify the query), and - dependent on lighting conditions - three of the six party policy cards can be indecipherable from each other at any distance. Hans im Gluck. 1997 $? (2010) Original  There is a lot to do in this game and it takes a long time to play. But, if everyone stays with it the time goes by quickly. Who would have thought that a political marathon of 5 hours could be fun? Die Macher allows you to enter the policital arena and wrestle with the lions so to speak. Schemeing, money from dubious sources, spin doctors, media manipulation; you name it, the game has it. And even though the game consists of seven identical elections (procedurally, that is; some are certainly more important than others) it never feels repetitive. As the political opinion develops gradually and can be influenced already well in advance to the actual vote forward planning is not only possible but quite crucial since you cannot simply turn your party platform around by 180 degress from one ballot to the next.  Ways to generate points exist aplenty, and sometimes the junior partner in a coalition is the real winner. There are ways to force unsuspecting victims into a coalition, and the ever-important last minute polls can cause huge swings in one direction or another so you better make sure they turn out in your favour.   Sometimes the amount of luck especially due to the polls feels like it might be a bit too much for a game this long, but it does even out somewhat over the course of the game, and you normally get benefits from any commissioned polls even if they aren\\'t quite what you were hoping for. Even if it seems you\\'re out after a particularly bad round you can normally claw your way back because everyone else is more intent on harrassing the current (perceived) leader and would rather team up with you than anyone else. I\\'m not sure how often Die Macher can hit the table because of both theme and length. I\\'m very sure I\\'ll try to be there when it does, though. takes a while to learn.  So many ways to win makes this game interesting for me.  Wish the card designs were better. Believe the hype - this is a great game which isn\\'t as much of a bear as it\\'s made out to be.  Wow Wow! I had not been too keen on trying this game as I thought it would be too solitarish, but was finally convinced at giving it a go at Spillorama 2010. And what a blast! This was a great experince and I can\\'t wait to play again. 5 hours with 4 players of which 2 were newbies. Yes, there is a bit of luck with the poll cards, but that is why you want to win the auctions for them. This will be directly put on my all time fave list.  Only one play so far but really enjoyed the game. Would like to play again now I understand more about how the game works. Hampered only by the play time though as it does take several hours to complete a game. One of my top ten games. Brilliant interconnected mechanics. A classic that\\'s stood the test of time. Brilliant, though long, political game. First time played Derek Carver\\'s variant, so some rules from the 1st edition mixed in with the 3rd; second time standard Valley Games rules. 5-4 A great game that was re-published by VG involving political strategy in Germany plays well with 5 players. You have your party platform and try to gain seats in different city elections while gaining points with the media, coinciding with the national political view, and increasing your political faction by gaining more people to your party. Granddaddy of Eurogames? Hell yeah.  Lots of interesting mechanics and therefore decisions.  Long play time, but worth it. 11.2019 A beautifully designed game. If you have a few hours to spare and you like politics, this is for you. A very procedural game, with good opportunities for swinging the odds in your favor over time. It also allows for you to not lead the game and still win enough votes over time if you can manage to keep a consistent good place. The re are unexplored opportunities on the area of coalitions whether forced or agreed upon, where you can take a leader down by getting together with another player in agreement. Man I want to play more of this game. An epic beast of a game. Min 4/Best 5 Considering it was released in 1986 is an absolutely amazing game. One of the best i\\'ve ever tried. After my first game i hardly recommend to every gamer give it a try. It is needed to have 5 or 6 hours to finish it. 5,3-5 Genius for 1986.  Does not show its age.  Lots of elegant mechanics working together to form a coherent, brilliant whole.  What games should strive for.   A five hour game should not feel this short, but Die Macher, amazingly, never seems to drag or overstay its welcome. It\\'s filled with a surprising number of random elements for a euro, but it lets everyone know about them with enough lead time to allow for strategic and not just tactical decision-making. More importantly, it lets the core of the gameplay be about player interaction and trying to outmaneuver your opponents. Euros often get smeared as \"multiplayer solitare\" and here is the ultimate counter example. Un jeu de politique. Oui il y a de l\\'optimisation, mais c\\'est très interractif. Chacun rivalise d\\'influence pour essayer d\\'aller chercher les votes et gagner les élections. Il y a beaucoup de profondeur dans le jeu et l\\'expérience est très satisfaisante malgré sa longueur (plus de 4 heures). played it twice for a good feeeling - but did not test it  thoroughly Under-appreciated game nowadays. Plays relatively quickly (3.5 hours) and is completely engrossing. A tad too much luck keeps it from being higher. Want to try the 1st Ed. Rules and see if we like them more than 3rd Ed. 5 hour game about German Politics. Fantastic but obviously hard to get to the table. (Bazaar @ [url=http://www.foirejeulongueuil.com/]FJL 2013[/url], from user [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/user/patachou15]patachou15[/url], 2013-09-08)  Outstanding game of politics, working as a party to win elections, set up a platform, and gain support. The game is deep but not too complicated, there\\'s plenty of interaction between players, and possible coalitions. Very entertaining game. Theme. Mechanics. 10 ! I just don\\'t like the power of some random polls ! Still one of the best game ideas ever !  4.3 Great and novel resource management game, each regional election is the map.  Want to play more. Very good election game, well constructed, challenging and enjoyable, but a bit too long to play more than occasionally A very long playing game based upon German elections. Plenty of decisions to be made. A real hit with me as I like both games and elections. It amazes me that this game is almost 30 years old. It\\'s still one of the best heavy euros around; thematic, deep, beautiful. Was tempted to give this a \\'10\\' if not for how long games take to finish. My friends and I played this at the cottage, we all fell in love with it, very tight design, lots of suspense, it\\'s really hard to tell who is going to come out on top until near the very end of the campaign. Would love to see a developer adapt Die Macher to another political context. Own the 2006 version. Any future versions could use better art/graphic design, art is perhaps the only sore spot in this version, looks like it\\'s bad CGI graphics from the 1990s.... Fantastic game that doesn\\'t get played enough. I love the auctions and the collaborations. Quite thematic en mecatol  sin enfundar Wow, this is worth playing once as a bucket list game.  Heavy but not super heavy.  Lovely lovely game! Far ahead of the times (1986). Still an underestimated great, evening filling game. Needs time to be learned. A eurogame that involves German political elections.  The theme is immersive if you love political action and policy making. Time (4 hours of play) is the great inhibitor for this game. Great, competitive and interactive power-broking game.  Completely worth playing Kick started expected November 2019--update Feb 2020 arrived Jan 21, 2020 Backed on Kickstarter   Played it a years ago regularly. So happy it goes back to print.  Great game! Kickstarted I already liked this game very much after the first play, but I like it more and more with each play. It\\'s so very thematic, I really feel like I have to win votes in the regions.  We had a weird game where I won handily though, mainly because I started out with a tableau which matched the opinion cards in the first region almost perfectly and it turned out to be the 80 points region. Not sure if we played it wrong, but that was not very nice because you just run away with the game immediately and that was pure luck. very good game Epic; 2019 version with downsized rules gains only 7.5 stars I love political games, and this one is very much unique in what it intends to do. I love how you need to shift your alliances two or three times every game in order to align yourself with the population expectations and win some local elections while still remain aware of the national alignment. The best part of this game for me was the auction for the opinion poll even though you might end up only throwing 2 dice! I paid $55,000 for 2 dice near the end of the game, brutal but it was fun anyway. Tons of details to think about and highly entertaining, this 7 hour game (first playing) was an emotional rollercoaster.  I finally got to play this classic.  I love the mechanics of it.  The last turn soured my opinion, however, as it was too much of a point swing.  I\\'ve since learned there is a variant to lessen the effect, so I\\'m anxious to give it another try. This game is a brilliant design. Elegant, simple systems that all feel exactly like what they are simulating. The only reason why I wouldn\\'t call it a ten is that it is hard to pitch a hard-core, heavy game about \"German Politics\" to the innocent. 我不清楚政治是什么样子，完了这个知道了一些。 It\\'s got it all.  Auctions, dice, temporary alliances, theme-mechanism interaction... it\\'s got a lot going on and yet it still seems smooth and intuitive. BGG ID: 1 ... first number one in BGG history. Well, it deserves this high appreciation, especially for its age. It\\'s a perfectly designed Euro game with possible offensive actions and huge player interaction. You have to plan your actions over several rounds and this is one of the complicated and brainburning things. The theme seems to be dry, but it absolutely isn\\'t. This is one of the greatest games! Mr. Schmiel: I take my hat off to you! Most interactive euro board game I have played. Super heavy and a masterpiece in game design . Theme is very strong. Fantastic game. Filled with interesting strategy decisions.  Every action has opportunity costs.  Money is tight, but taking corporate donations loses party membership.  Party platform that gets votes in Rheinland-Pfalz may be worse than useless in Niedersachsen.  If you use the Finanz-Minister to buy votes, you can\\'t also use him to improve voter perception of your Party.  If you take control of the media for a big State\\'s election far in advance, you can\\'t use those media cubes to influence public opinion in the current State\\'s election.  The choices just go on and on.  As a bonus, who doesn\\'t love being pro-nuclear or anti-genetic engineering, all in German? rules in spanish After playing this you may acctual appriciate politics. I know that I now enjoy german politics. Too bad the US can\\'t have five competitive parties. Outstanding game!!! I could give it a 9+ for the shorter version.  Long game but what a game! !! Well worth the time to learn. ..can\\'t wait to play it again! ! Very procedural game which keeps people involved all the time. Very little downtime for a five hour monster. Lot\\'s and lot\\'s of difficult decisions to make which will keep te game tense until the end. Very good translation of theme to a great game. Very highly recommended.  Gameplay: :star::star::star::star::halfstar: Replayability: :star::star::star::star::halfstar: Fun/Social: :star::star::star::star::halfstar: Components: :star::star::star::nostar::nostar: Rules: :star::star::star::star::nostar:  Will burn your brain really bad in its awesomeness! Love this game, but I can only get it played at conventions. Have only managed to play this once due to it\\'s heavyweight nature, I\\'m looking forward to playing this again. At the top end of complexity for German games. How could anyone guess that a game themed upon German legislative elections could be so good? And thoroughly enjoyable, despite the many hours of play-time? The key is an incredibly solid system with perfectly-matched phases and lots of options for fine-tuning your tactics. Brilliant. Good game, need to play more to figure it out a bit better though The best title on this theme. This should probably be a 9, but I want to play it again to make sure. Played [-]once[/-] twice and enjoyed it very much - if only I had the time to play it more!  So long!  And so meaty!  And it feels so good while you\\'re doing it!  And when you\\'re done, you just collapse in exhaustion, totally satiated.  *stares off into space, dreamily*  NB: I might be one of the only people for whom this theme is a plus. German politics. Based on one play. Think you need 4-5 to make it intersting. Has structed play but you have many decisions that will affect the outcome. Will consider buying the upcoming reprint. Just played for the first time - superb - play time would be shorter if we knew the game better and chose to play faster - However I still feel it needs some house rules to play faster. I like the depth of the game and the different choices you had to make (many possible paths to victory). I am desperate to play it regulaly but feel it will rarely get on the table due to equickly popular games that dont take 4-5 hourse to play. Fantastic game; can\\'t recommend highly enough.  Takes some time, burns your brain, but all worth it.  Tne best election game.  Takes 4 hrs.   Finally got a chance to play it. A bit steep on the learning curve, but once rolling was great fun. Lots to do and LOTS to think about. Hindered a tad IMO by the randomness of a few aspects and by a common problem of early mistakes costing you too much. The length keeps it from being a 9 in my book, but still a great game, a classic for a reason. A long game (4 - 4.5 hours). But i\\'m always surprised that much time has passed ... seems to be much shorter, since you\\'re involved all the time.  Maybe should upgrade the rating to 9. But then, the game *is* long... Very good game. I like games to take about 3 to 5 hours, with enough time to implement some strategy and harvest the fruits of it! This game is excellent in this respect, with being able to plan four turns ahead but with many aspects to take into consideration! Wow, who would have thought that german politics could be so interesting?! Lots of interaction, but at the same time players are firmly in control of their destiny. I like the way that future elections can be planned for/influenced, but without having perfect information, and how that information slowly becomes available. The one thing that the game is missing is a card/action that would allow you to draw more party agenda cards -- as it is the luck of the draw can sometimes be crippling, with no recourse for that. I\\'m sure playtime could go down to 2.5hrs once the players are familliar with the turn order and how things interact with each other.  It took nearly 6 hours but it felt like 3.  Great game. Rating after one play.  Didn\\'t really have a great grasp on the inter-related mechanics, but it wasn\\'t as hard to play as  I had expected. Very unique concept and well executed; it does have the feel of a real election.  I really like this game, despite the fact that artwork is kinda terrible.  Art doesn\\'t usually bother me, except that in this game, the cards are not only ugly, but somewhat ambiguous at times - several cards have nearly identical images on them (Valley Games edition).  Anyway, if you have any interest in politics, this is worth trying out. Was everything I hoped it would be. First game for 5 players took 4 hours. This we believe would be 3 hours next time. Enjoyable, cutthroat, thought provoking. Very very enjoyable.   1st game/4 players/full version/~400min  Strong game - a bit complex in points, but it all adds up and works together beautifully. I\\'ve only played this game a few times, but I have thoroughly enjoyed myself every time.  This game even converted a few skeptics who were on the fence about the enjoyment of board games. My mother will play Die Macher but not Agricola, Pandemic, Blue Moon City, T&T, Dominion, etc. On the flip side, she\\'s started fighting me for my Doctor Who Solitaire booklets. No, I don\\'t understand, either. A great game.  It would be 9 or higher if it wasn\\'t quite so long. Excellent game with a dizzying mix of mechanics that work well together and allow for long term strategizing as well as rewarding clever tactical play. Only drawbacks are game length and learning curve; sitting in on more than 2 learning games can be brutally irritating.  There are more interesting mechanics more seemlessly put together than any game I know.  Amazing how it\\'s impossible to find time for a bathroom break while playing a 4-hour game! 2009-09-20 - I really like this game but it is hard to find players. But when it does come out, boy, is it ever something else! I\\'ve never been so enthralled for the whole 4 hours or so that it goes on. It is not a particularly hard game; it is very procedural. Highly recommended.  2006-09-11 - preordered; received soon after 2009-09-19 - Sold Fallcon 22 Plenty of mechanisms all layered onto the core game concepts and with each interacting with one or more of the others. Very nice balance between fully tactical (this region\\'s election), near term (the next three regions) and strategic (the national board\\'s party size and policy alingment areas). While bidding can seem somewhat random early on, I think this was due to our not fully grog\\'ing the whole interconnected game design. Bidding was much more focused and fierce in the latter half of the game. Kingmaking is avoided to some degree as the ability to deduce who is truly ahead is out of reach (although some folks will still identify a leader and act based on that). I waited - oh, 10 years to get this to the table. I shouldn\\'t have waited that long. Fun game! It is long, and does take at least one play through to both understand the round mechanics (well, one or two rounds for that), and the scoring. But, the spiteful poll auction tension made me giggle.  The only thing wrong with this game is that, like its fellows in awesome largitude 1830 and Titan, it\\'s just too long to play more often.  (First game took six and a half hours, and that\\'s not even counting rules.)  Valley games edition This game was very enjoyable. I liked the fact you couldn\\'t change every aspect of your party\\'s platform to appeal to the current political winds. You needed to change slowly and only if you had the will (\\'cards\\') to do it. Every bit as good a game in most ways but docked half a point in comparison as the second edition copes better with different numbers of players. 25.11.2007: Phew! I expect the rating to rise on this one, because it\\'s good. This game has it all, long term planning, tactical play, direct interaction, low downtime, and quite simple rules in the end. But it\\'s also a long game, mostly because there is so much things going on in a round. If all players are familiar with the game you can probably play it in less than four hours, but then you have to stay focused the whole time and keep the analysis paralysis at a minimum. My first game took five and a half hours (setup and rules explaining included), but we were all somewhat familiar with the rules. One other thing that is good with the game is that you can probably start playing right away if you have one person who knows the rules. The first turn you can explain each phase of the round when it happens, and by the end of the round everybody will probably have a good grasp of how the game works. The rules are that simple and intuitive. The only negative thing I have to say about it is the length. It\\'s a game you want to buy, because it\\'s so good, but you know it won\\'t get play as often as you\\'d like, because of the length.

It takes a while to click but, when it does, whoa, baby.  But will I ever have a chance to play it again...? à vendre The mother of all games, and an awesome game at that. Really not that difficult and truly fun to play. Takes a while though, but it\\'s worth it every which way! Din exactly finished my 2nd game, but the first game alone is enough for me to give this game a 10. Definitely a mature and game i wan to associate myself with. So many interesting gaming mechanics, yet it does not weigh down on theme and human interaction.  aug 2009: [9] It\\'s a beast  feb 2011: [8.5] lower its rating due to lots of time needed to play yet other good games exist to be played in less time but more brain burning Beast of a euro. Classic example of interconnected strategy weaved throughout a complex play experience. Not for the casual gamer but a must-play for the hardcore, particularly of euros. Rating based on two plays. This game is almost perfect in its design. It\\'s not as complicated as the rules make it seem. Visually kind of meh. Looking forward to playing with more players which will probably raise the rating to a 9. Nederlandse regels in originele opmaak (zw/w) Engelse regels in originele opmaak I\\'ve played it. It took 5 hours for 5 of us to march through the game. I really liked it. It never felt slow or bogged down. There\\'s not much room for AP ever in the game. But it is the same game played basically 6 times in a row. Each state is resolved as you peer ahead to the next 3 coming up. At times, you start getting plans laid out and other times, you find you made a mistake. The random \\'poll\\' cards are harsh and scary and frankly, I love \\'em. They add spice to an otherwise nearly precise mathematical experience (something I generally do not like in a game). I like the dodge and match game with your platforms vs. opponents vs. the state vs. the national end game. There\\'s really nothing else like the granddaddy of heavy Euros. And there likely never will be. Very fun. Awesome game. I want to play again :D Always fun to play, however I can only sytand to play it 2 to three times per year. Good game, but hard to find people willing to play it. The granddaddy of Euro games. Many, many layers of mechanics. Very deep, very intense. In some ways, mechanically speaking, it felt like a game of super-ultra-advanced Catan. una de mis asignaturas pendientes, de los juegos a los que mas ganas le tengo pero que es excesivamente \"duro\" para mi grupo habitual de juego.  11/03/2015 Por fin le hemos jugado... y no es tan fiero el león como le pintan. La verdad es que me encanta, por temática, por mecánicas, por jugabilidad..... Como pero, y muy gordo, el arte del juego. Unas ilustraciones nada agradables que no relacionas con lo que significan en el juego y que hacen mas engorroso meterte en la partida. deseando volver a jugarle A game like no other, you have to pick your fights, you can\\'t win them all, interesting mechanics, didn\\'t like the trade cards because they were so static.   Just read the rules, not played yet. The game is very structured and tense! The theme and the rules work very well! Need play soon! Referred to as the Holy Grail of board games. A game that mimics the German political system. A brilliant game of cutthroat and coalition politics. The classic political Euro, for good reason. Ugly as sin, but I love it anyway. I\\'ve only been able to convince folks to play the shortened version.  Apr\\'16 May up to 9 rating with more plays. But it\\'s too long a game for me. I may consider 5 rounds. This game has everything you want out of a deep, heavy game: tension, tough decisions, diplomacy, politicking for position, minor arguments, and players always willing to help one another by advising them on what their best play really should be. Superlative game. (May 2016)  Highlight: 2016 (August 2016) Epic yet long, even if you do the short version (5 rounds). Might be difficult to find players who enjoy German political games, but the theme shines through, the mechanics are varied yet work well together, and there\\'s a good balance between going for your own strategy and screwing your fellow political strategists. To be played at least once.  선거의 비중이 조금만 더 높았다면 더욱 사실감 있을 듯.. 게임의 점수획득 루트를 다양하게 만들고 그 루트간 밸런싱을 위해 미디어의 영향력이 너무 지나친 느낌. 그래도 좋은 게임. Jan; KS November 2019 - Januar 2020 First play last night. Solid game. Really want to play the original now. Will definitely play this a bunch more (hopefully 10 times). The rating could go up to a 9, but also could go down to an 8, but a solid game none-the-less. Played the first game 3 player in under 3 hours (not including teach - which is longish). I think the time on the game box is accurate (150 minutes) for probably a 4 player game once everyone has played it once. Played the 2019 version as I was told this is the most streamlined edition of out the previous 3. Most intense and complex game I\\'ve ever played so far. There is no clear cut strategies to win VPs, as there are many unexpected turns of events done by other players that affects every 9 steps of the rounds. Game mechanism is well thought out. Very much enjoy the satire of this! Also interesting game play! Anyone who likes complicated long ganes, this one is a must.  Too many levers and ways to win.  Players whould be relatively combative in the game as it is more fun that way. Great game with tons of planning and strategy. The endgame has a little too much chaos for me but still a cool experience. I can\\'t get enough of this one.  It is hard to find a good group of players though.  Real old school masterpiece!!! However playing time makes it rarely to hit the table. old timer but not evergreen.  Valley games international edition  Update june 2009 : I\\'ve played the game once now. Not too sure we played the national issues right. They gave me a lot of points.  If The last election was worth more votes than the previous I would have probably won. Or if James lost 2 spots in the preultimate election instead (draw poll) Allthough Mike would have ended before me. Or if the cities would have been switched for the last two elections would have changed. Or if the winner of the fifth election poll wouldn\\'t have dropped me down two spots (I didn\\'t look in a good shape) because it was the only thing he could do that was worthwhile to him I would have had scored 27 more points in that election and have enough money to compete in the preultimate election.   So a lot of ifs and I\\'m pretty sure this goes for a  lot of players. Michael would have won against James if it weren\\'t for me changing the issues after the election.   Anyway this tells a lot about the game. It is much closer than I thought it would be and the question now for me now is should it really be so close and and should the winner be decided on the final poll?  Probably not.  I still rate it a solid 8 as I would love to play the game more and see if I could make it more in a game about timing (like Power grid)  If it is more about timing the game will overtake Power grid as my most beloved game.  But to be honest I don\\'t really think so. You could save up the most money and if you draw your card in the final election and move it it could win you the game.  Even turnorder could decide it. For a game theat takes over 4 hours to complete it is all a bit to close and lucjk dependant for me.  Having said that there is so much to keep track of and consider. One thing isn\\'t necessaraly better than the other thing so for me it still works.  UPDATE MAY 2010 Definately need to play this again. I still have doubts about the luckfactor or kingmaking (chosing by another player who wins). It can be my most beloved game or a good six as I enjoy playing it.   This game is absolutely amazing. It will not be a game I can play often due to the length, but it was 4+ hours of continuous engagement with all four players. Even though turns are long, your almost just as engaged in the other players turns as you are with your own turn. Liked it a lot! one unpunched. We really enjoyed our own play of this. I know it\\'s a cliche to say how this game surprises you on how fun it is, but that\\'s exactly the way we felt about it.  1 play.  4 hours.  4 players. Great game. Thoroughly engrossing. Very Little downtime as each players moves are very pivotal to your own struggle.  Want to play again. soon.  &nbsp  2nd play lasted about 3.5 hours with the same 4 players but about 8 months later.  First election refamiliarised ourselves with the mechanics and it was no holds bar from then on in.  Excellent game and time flies by - it is very heavy.   Player interaction is constant, and everyone\\'s decisions affect your position.  Increasing rating to 8 (Dec 07). Listed 7/7/08  [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekbuddy.php3?action=doanalyze&groupid=4204&B1=Analyze&gameid=1]Ratings[/url] My only guff with this game is that for some reason they used comic sans. So to keep it from infecting the fontography of the rest of my games collection, I keep it in a special sealed container that requires a passcode and retina scan to access, much like how superman keeps one of his pieces in kryptonite.  Also all my friends don\\'t think \"A board game about german parliamentary elections\" sounds appealing! Heavyweight political game, but once you get in to the swing of it, the rules are not as complicated as you might think. The game rounds repeat a few times so once you have got to grips with the game process, you\\'ll find that same process repeating until you start to thin out the remaining regions to campaign in, thus eventually ending the game, when all votes are in.   The mechanics ensure that you cannot dominate every region and although there are some random elements to factor in (opinion polls and the like) these are exactly the sorts of things that may appear in a real electoral campaign. You won\\'t dominate every region and you won\\'t get screwewd in every region. I like the way that you can bank some early impact in a region (before the vote takes place) to guarantee yourself votes. This usually won\\'t guarantee that you win the region but it can put other players off or make you a strong force in a coalition. These votes can\\'t be reduced by a sudden swing against you. If 2 players reach 50 votes (the maximum possible) then the second player to reach 50 win by a nose - another cunning game mechanic which makes control of turn order vitally important.  This will take you 4 or 5 hours to play though, so you have to be committed to the game before you start. Who knew German elections could be that entertaining. 3-5 players Enjoyable, but not as complex as I was led to believe. Not as complex as it seems, one of the few German games in which you can really plan ahead. What a great synthesis of a so many mechanics.  Somehow they all meld together so well into the theme.  Learning curve is rather steep and the prolonged brain burn can make endurance a factor. Very good game, but has a lot of rules and takes a long time to play. All German Politics - how could it be good? Well, it is. A bit to long compared to modern standard, but still a fun game. Incredible game, only drawback is length and rules translation. Liked quite a lot after one game. The classic big game Euro. The luck comes in torrents, from the polls, to getting lucky matches in the big scoring regions. The good news is that there\\'s lots of opportunities to manage the luck, and good alliances can help as well. Lots to enjoy, but the length and dry subject matter makes it a once a year game. Not a game for the faint of heart.  There are so many things you can do, yet such limited resources.  Do I focus on *this* region, or work on the next region?  Votes, trends, media, party meetings, membership - you can\\'t do it all.  Wonderfully tense. Better with 4/5 than with 3. Takes a while, but has interesting mechananics Played quite a number of times. So much going on here there might be TOO much going on. The game can still came down to one opinion card - which is both good and bad. I\\'m more than up to play it though. Everytime I think I have a set strategy, I find some new way to manipulate the game. The levels of complexity make this game hard to learn, but rewarding to play once you understand how everything works together. I would like to play it more often but you realy have to do a time schedule to get enough people willing to play so many hours. last time we played until 5 in the morning... I can now see what all of the fuss is about...everything comes together like a beautiful work of art.  Brilliant. One of the best Multiplayer games I have played. I only have the 1st edition and the rule translations could use a little more clarity but other than that it\\'s as good a 4 player game as anyone can want. Strangely enough, my non-gamer wife loves this game.  I recently got to play it again, and got skunked, agan.  Deep, interesting, decisions out the yin-yang. Lovely blend of theme and mechanics. The King Shit Pooba of German Gaming.  It\\'s long and seemingly complex, but it\\'s not really that bad once you get the gist of an election in a region.  I still have a sore-spot for those poll cards and I\\'d love to hear from someone who\\'s playtested a nice variant for \\'em.  As money\\'s worth reduces in the end-game, the randomly pulled poll cards can be uber powerful... Excellent game. But, my fellows had problem of playing time and difference of political life. So I gave -2 point. An excellent way to spend 4 hours or so. Would rate this higher if it was a bit less random, still it is a very good game.  Optimal play is with 4 players, 5 is too many as it makes the game too tight and usually forces at least one player into a unwinnable position by midway through the game. 1st edition & 2nd edition (1.ed) Teutonic grey cells burner which manages to be FUN. Single play, but greatly enjoyed. Hoping to get another game in soon. Decisions, decisions, decisions.  So many ways to mess up and so much fun trying to keep a straight face when playing the \\'sinker\\' Opinion Poll against that troublesome opponent.  Grand Game! Probably the best poolitical game.  The only real problem is the money and polls--you have too much money (especially late in the game) and often have little to spend it on except \"polls\" (so large bidding wars devcelop on random cards). Very original, highly interactive, and quite balanced given the number of intertwined mechanics. The game is not that difficult to play, dont be afraid by the size of the rulebook. Even though it is quite long, and not at all devoid of randomness, I still found the experience enjoyable and rewarding. For a game as economic as this one, it feels quite balanced. So far, it doesn\\'t seem to have as big a \\'rich gets richer\\' problem as other games of this nature have.  Square Tomatoes!!! A tad too long.  Fantastic, marvelous game, though. PROs: *) Clever mechanics that make you think twice where you commit your resources *) Lots of player interaction *) Feels pretty balanced overall *) Tight and exciting till the end  CONs: *) It does take long to get into it - the rules are quite complex, and some mechanisms are not obvious (although the rulebook is not badly written). Rating after one play. The gameboard is boring, but the rest is ... G R E A T The magum opus. Takes a long time to play though -- 5-8 hours for our group. It takes a game to get your head around everything that\\'s going on, but after that Die Macher is the most fun \\'long\\' game I know. I think the most notable thing about it, being a rather long game, is that there is absolutely no down time. It really manages to keep you constantly involved. It is also surprisingly fun for a heavy game, with just the right balance of control and luck/chaos.  Highly recommended. less would have been more! Too much going on, and certainly too long. I do love the core mechanics, and rate it a 9 for the 3 (and a half) round version. Played the full number of rounds (5 hours) I rate it a 6.  PS. Played this just prior to the German 2021 election. I\\'m surprised that it aged so well, but even more surprised how relatively  easy this now seems! Compared to current games, this is medium complexity at the most. This game is fantastic but is undoubtly an \"older\" game, there have been some incredible mechanics advances in the gaming world over the past 10 years and this game is lacking them.  What they need to do is get someone like Reiner Knizia to completely redesign this game in anyway he likes an call it \"Die Macher II\" - then it would defintely be the greatest game ever.  Another thing, just like designers are always trying to make a \\'playable\\' Civilization game, I think the quest for a \\'playable\\' Die Macher game would be a real gem.  I really wish more political themed games were designed. Our group has to plan to play this one, but it\\'s always something special when we do.  Honestly, I don\\'t even remember if I\\'ve ever won - it\\'s all about enjoying the process. Quite simply the most involved, rewarding, and intense game ever. Would be nice if there were a shorter variant. 5 hours of juggling. for 4 player version This game is long and complex, usually not the best match for my tastes.  But it\\'s also very good!  The game mechanics do as good job as I\\'ve seen of capturing the complexities of running an election campaign.  It takes some work to get the rules straight, but I believe this game is worth the effort! Based on one play.  Loved it. A game about german politics does not sound very interesting at first. It is quite complex, having lots of phases and a rather tricky scoring system. But once you get the hang of it, it won\\'t let you go. The mechanics are actually quite logical and work well together. --Sep2013-- Way too long to get it to the table. (It arrived in my house in Feb of 2006!)  But really quite worthwhile when it finally happened.  It\\'s got some randomness; some serious volatility; and lots and lots of opportunity for clever (or, in my case, foolish) play.  Really happy to play it again - though it may be a while.  I\\'d be sad if it took more than a couple years to play again, though. Wow!  Very steep initial learning curve, but soon starts to fall into place.  So much to think about, when I\\'m done playing all I can do is think about what I should have done or what I could do next time.  I hope I get to play this again soon.  So much fun, you don\\'t even really notice the time go by.  Everyone else that observed the game from the outside in passing was talking about how long it was taking, but I didn\\'t notice at all.  I really like the theme of this game. I\\'ve enjoyed my playings of this game. I just wish that we could play it a few times in succession so that we could all remember the rules instead of getting together early enough to relearn the game before playing. Only one play. Enjoyable experience. I have an unplayed copy of this game, I really love the theme and rules, but haven´t had the opportunity to play it. [Schmiel] Tentative rating after a learning game: Isn\\'t *really* as long or as fussy as everyone makes it out to be. Please, it\\'s no Civ! It seems like it has enough rounds to permit plenty of long-term strategy, which is a big plus for me. I was also surprised to find that several of my favorite games are really just boiled-down portions of Die Macher! A seminal design indeed! a very good game. A bit unforgiving. Lot of integrated mechanics, be sure you know how things hang together so you don\\'t fall behind :) A fun, if involved 6 hour marathon of a game where you compete to win elections in different states of Germany.  You pay for local marketing and rally the base, build local organizations and grow you support to win the national election.  Your party line changes and so does the opinion of the masses.  I fun game with lots of strategy and some luck, lots of things going on to think about but very good. Die Macher is the best election/political game I\\'ve encountered and does a really good job in portraying a year of German electoral campaigns (save of course that for the purposes of the game party platforms are readily changeable). There is plenty of room for clever play. Definitely an ambitious gamer\\'s game and a deserving classic.  My first game clocked in at round four hours - sadly seeing the CDU I championed (and favour also in real life) not establishing Adenauer-like political hegemony. We had lots of fun playfully sniping away at each other\\'s parties and agendas. If you\\'re into that, you\\'ll definitely find this game anything but dry and abstract.  However, at four hours, it\\'s really longer than it really wants to be. Okay, I can see this being a three hour game with people more familiar with the game, but in my view a shorter variant covering fewer electoral campaigns would be a good idea. Struggle of Empires - a game of similar complexity and ambition - clocks in at round three hours. A bit of streamlining (and decreased play time in consequence) might have helped getting Die Macher regular to the table.  Still, it is still easily playable in an evening, so it\\'s not that big an issue (from what I had read I thought it takes longer). More of a good thing, really. And the benefit of these longer games is that those - rarer - plays are far more memorable than your typical game of Puerto Rico & Co.  [14/12/05] Played a second time and enjoyed it thoroughly. Yet let me say that income rises too much in the game, leading to fabulous sums of money spent on auction - thereby dwarfing all other forms of expenditure. This is a shame since a financially tigher game would add another decision layer which doesn\\'t really come into its own here. Moreover, in real life parties are pretty broke at the end of a campaign. The reverse happens in Die Macher. One of those loose ends in this game\\'s design. As said, Die Macher ain\\'t perfect, but it\\'s a very fine game nonetheless. initial rating  After reading the rules and many hyped forum threads on here this game became one of my most desired games I have ever wanted to play, and I hate Politics. The thing is that even though I hate Politics, this is one of the best themed games I have ever played, that is, the theme works perfectly with the mechanics and it is a very important part of the gameplay. This game went from my most wanted game to play, due to the high strategy element to one of my bigger disapointments for the following reasons:  1. Opinion polls, for a very long high strategy game this element of extreme randomness just seemed out of place and ended up being close to a game breaker.   2. Usually I don\\'t mind long games but I think this could benefit by being shortened even though it is so damn engrossing that the time goes by quickly, 5 or 6 rounds instead of 7 would be a nice change and I recommend that you try it the first game, I will insist on a 5 round game my next game (if there is one).   3. Turn order seems way to important in the game, again for a long strategy game this should not be left up to a silent auction (blind bid), an open auction might be better also assuming money is hidden. The better alternative is to leave this as is and change election victory conditions, see #4.  4. The \"50\" cap on votes seems fine for money purposes and maybe seats/victory points but IMHO total votes should decide who actually wins an election rather than \"the last person to get 50 votes wins\" which means who ever has the most money will win the auction and therefore win the election, rich get richer.   5. When winning an election as a \"Coalition\", the switching of cards on the National Board should be done as the strongest showing switching last instead of first, switching last seems more important and the stronger showing in the election should get to do this not vice versa.   This game has a TON of potential and hopefully some tweaks will be implemented in the reprint, this game definitely has 10 potential or pretty close to it. As is this is still a great but long game, lots of great mechanics that work very well together, lots of strategy and a strong theme keep this game from falling below an 8, reasons stated above keep it from going higher. After playing some deep games I haven\\'t tried yet which looks to be 10 or so more and then this one some more I will see if my opinion changes and modify my comments and rating accordingly. All I can say is wow.  I think the opinion polls may swing the game too much but so what.  This game kills 4-5 hours so fast it only feels like 1 or 2 have flown by.  I haven\\'t had the sun creep up on me since my Titan days.  Awesome. I finally got a chance to play this game and was suprised by how \"American\" the game felt. Lot\\'s of fiddly bits and rules. A huge amount of upkeep and a very necessary detailed turn chart to plow through every turn. But, I loved it! The game was strategic and multi-dimensional. It only gets a ding for the 4 hours it takes to play. Die Macher is a very good game, although not the nirvana orgasm holy grand poobah of gaming that it\\'s sometimes made out to be.  It was an astonishing game for its time, and still holds up very well.  When I first played, I was shocked at the huge role that luck plays in the opinion polls and (especially) in the regional issues.  That\\'s not what I had expected of a game that\\'s often portrayed as the mother of all German heavyweight games, and is a little disappointing for a game of this length and complexity.  Best with five. Good, very interesting game.  Has some flaws: money spirals out of control as the game goes on which is weird, too much hinges on the last two provinces, the popularity polls inject too much randomness.  Intense and engrossing, there is no parallel multiple-solitaire play here: everything is player vs player, sometimes as coalition partners, sometimes as enemies. I was skeptical of this game. I had played a few four hour games in the past and they were not pleasant (diplomacy as an example). I learn more each time I play. The game has several different methods to score points. The only down side to the game is the length of instruction. Time passes quickly as you play. Played once. Very fun game. Lots going on. A bit discouraged by the way matching the National Agenda seems far more important than winning seats, but I haven\\'t played enough to verify that this is always the case. Got the Valley Games edition and loved my first play! Everything affects everything else.  You need to simultaneously plan for all the elections currently showing (four) while keeping some resources in reserve for the future.  If you like PoF, and can deal with the 3 hour playtime (assuming your group is fast), and can get four or five players to sit down for this, you\\'ll have a blast. I\\'ve thrown down my pre-order from Valley Games .. It\\'s all paid up.  Now I wait.  Arrived!  UPDATE:  The rules are crazy.. so is the concept.  I think I may just have to play some solitaire first before I even try and sell my friends on this game.  UPDATE:  After sitting through the Board Games with Scott episode of Die Macher with a friend (A must see!!) I breathed a heavy sigh and thought, \"Awesome... but not today.\"  This game will require heavy planning ahead of time to see the light.  But it will.  It\\'s staying in my collection for sure.  UPDATE:  I finally tried to get the game to the table.  I even scheduled it in Facebook for crying out loud.  My players bailed on me and the game didn\\'t take place.  It\\'s just too daunting for some.  Very frustrating.    UPDATE:  I\\'ve now played this after, most likely, two years of owning it.  Worked out something like this:  11:00am - I watch BGWS episode on \\'Die Macher\\' 1:45pm - Guests arrive 2:15pm - Guests watch BGWS episode on \\'Die Macher\\' (they hadn\\'t seen it) 3:15pm - Potential to be overwhelmed steps in.  Make a quick snack and have a coffee. 3:30pm - Start.  Players are given colours, and play begins. 4:15pm - First round done.  ([I]Seven of these??[/i]) 5:40pm - Hungry, must order pizza. 6:20pm - Pizza arrives, break for dinner. 7:00pm - Resume 8:00pm - Friends stop in to say \\'Hi\\' 8:30pm - Resumes 9:00pm - \"So waitaminute, we [i]only score[/i] on round seven?! ~10:00pm -   Black / CDU/CSU / Karen - 215 Red / SPD / Dan - 223 Green / Die Grunen / Pam - 303 Pink / Die Linken / Dave - 276  11:00 pm -  A fun game.  Heavy on the brain, but exciting.  We played it incorrectly on a few points (adding up party increase correctly based on party platform that matches national opinion and having the bonus for having more votes than all others combined in a district, amongst others) and decided not to revert to the correct play as not to penalize anyone.  We could see that it would be tight, but also knew by the end of round 5 that Dan and Karen didn\\'t really have a chance to win.  I own the valley games edition.  We all agreed that the iconography was poor.  There was an understanding by the group as to why there was no text on the cards (even if we all agreed that it would be better to have had it), but we didn\\'t like how the icons were difficult to tell apart from across the table. This slowed things down while players had to reach over to double check the opinion cards both players and districts.  I would very much enjoy buying a new set of cards that are closer to the original game (well, the HiG edition that was on BGWS would have been great.)  Also - the pink colour is pretty interesting, and I only assume that the colour was chosen over blue was because pink [i]actually is[/i] associated with \"die linken\" in German politics.  Giving this game a 8.  Would love to play it again but would enjoy it more if there were not so many breaks.  I give this [i]Edition[/i] of die macher a 3.  I just find that the choices made by the art department were bad.  Front the front cover to the rules to the board(s) to the cards.  There is no localization here and the lack of text on the cards is frustrating.  We all agreed that the game would have been better if the cards had SOME kind of text on them - even German.  At first it was confusing to see red checkboxes and red \\'down arrows\\' and understand they are the same, when all throughout the game everything depends on icons matching.  Icon choices are also bad.  Clip art would have been better (or at least easier to discern from a distance).  All icons.  (let\\'s be real here).  The new icons are complicated and lack simplicity.  The backs of the cards are bad.  All of the backs are the same (blue cloud-like pattern) but have a graphic in the middle.  The shadow cabinet round suffers because there is no text on the cards.. \"what am I playing here?  A whip?\"  This detracts from the mood and does not pursue theme.  Rule book is well-written.  Technical writing is well done.    I, personally, do not like the art on the box or the fonts, or anything about the box.  I find it very unappealing.  Unfortunately, this theme of \"design choices I do not agree with\" is carried throughout the entire game.  As an interesting case study, the game has been designed to be sold in any language right out of the box (cd included for rules in many other languages) and as such, pulls the text from the cards. We found that decision to be detrimental to the game.  Any text is better than none in this game.  I also have to rate it so harshly because [i][b]these design choices impact the desire to play this game again in a negative way.[/i][/b]  I\\'ll be lucky to play this game twice in a year.  Holy living crap. Intense, intricate, and demanding--but so incredibly engaging that the time flies. Also has a surprising amount of fun factor, especially if you have any knowledge of German politics. Awesome game, but I wish that the polls weren\\'t so powerful. [EDIT] It is lunacy that the new Speilworxx edition does not have its own entry. I can only assume that fetishization of being #1 in the BGG database has prevented the split... Anyway, the new edition is a winner. I can quibble with the shortening of the game, but the alterations to the polls and how card flow works is much cleaner and better. Wow.  This was another big hit for me from BGG.con.  It was completely engaging and I think it\\'s great. 2005/11/07 737 (original edition), 948 (International Edition) Wow!  A game that lived up to all of the hype and them some.  Worth the wait to get it - highly recomended, but you\\'ll need a strong gaming group to get the most out of this one.   For a deep strategy game, Die Macher is surprisingly easy to learn.  Although it is long, the time flies by.  Every auction, every decision (of which there are a ton), every move you make affects the future in a meaningful way.  Who knew German politics could be so fun?  This very much deserves its high rating here.  A rich and thick game.  Although it can really fry your brain, I think the theme integration and the fact that you are always involved makes it a worthwhile experience.  Not for the faint of heart. This was my 2006 Secret Santa gift!!!  Thank you Santa! I have a 3rd. Edition (Valley Games). First was a wonderful experience!  The length of the game will make it a little tough to get out, though.  I can usually find someone to play the longer two-player wargames, but longer multi-player games are more difficult.  Still, this is on the high end of a short list (along with Struggle of Empires) if I can get the right people together.  Very much looking forward to the time I can play this again.  Even played rarely, still worthy of a high rating. It\\'s really too bad it takes about five hours to play. Otherwise, I\\'d want to see Die Macher on the table more often. While the theme is dry, the game itself is full of meaningful decisions and enough interaction between players to keep things interesting. Wow!  Better than I thought it would be!  And I had high expectations!    My rating applies to the Hans im Gluck version of the game. Ah, so that is why this game is so famous. Don\\'t let the amazingly bland graphic design and the fact that you may or may not be familiar with German elections or political parties prevent you from trying out this classic. Pretty darn Stout!  Lots going on and lots to do.  Need more plays so I can \"Get It\". This will probably be a 10 when I get a full game in.  Wow.  It is better than advertised.  So much going on.  Two small quibbles, the order that you do things (counter-clockwise/clockwise) is a bit confusing and it wasn\\'t on our cheat sheet.  I can\\'t hold it against the player guide or the game, but it is something worth remembering.  I also think that the game could use an example round for teaching new players.  I need to check out the video made for this (Scott\\'s?)  After 2.5 games, this game is really, really good.  Lost the last game by 5 points, and looking back there were so many things I could have done differently to made them up.  I like that.  Here is a game where you can pursue your own course of action and try things out.  The only reason I don\\'t rate this higher, is that in between plays I don\\'t feel the call that other games have on me.  When I am playing it is a great game though.  :star::star::star::nostar: A classic and engaging game in which all the parts work together to make an amazing whole.  I regret that it\\'s so hard to organize a game of Die Macher.  I have only 2 plays recorded on BGG, but I played several times before I started recording all my plays.  I probably played it about 3 times before that. Great game.  Really have to work many different mechanics to accomplish such a simple goal.  Match your party\\'s platform with the public platform is the object...but how can you achieve this using minimal resources?  I can easily see this game being bumped up to a 9 with repeat plays.  I\\'m holding back because I\\'m just a bit worried that players tend to gravitate towards the same issues.  In the 1st edition I think this was the case and each election had pretty much the same issues (with one person getting locked out each time). However, with a 5th player revised rules (max of 6 cards in exchange pool), this could be a complete non-issue.  This needs to get played more often.  Update:  After 5 or so plays, I think I\\'ll leave it at 8. It\\'s a great game, but you have to draw the right issues at the right time.  Or you have to hope to get in coalitions.  If you focus on a region only to get left out of a coalition, it can really hurt your position.  Let it happen more than once, and it\\'s probably irrecoverable. I don\\'t have issues w/this in diplomatic games.  But this one feels a little  euro-ish to break out the Diplomacy hat and start wheelin and dealin. Big and meaty.  I enjoyed it.  It took 5 hours to play (not including rules) and it was totally worth it. Great, based on one game.  Very keen to try it again. Played two games. Rich and deep, it deserves it its reputation! I like this game very much, although I have seen it stress otherwise unflappable and happy people.. I dont know if I like the stress this game generates in people, since it can get pretty tense. I\\'d play it again, most likely only with people who already know how to play since it takes so darn long for new players to learn. Impressive political game.  I call it the Agricola of election games, because it\\'s all about micro-management. You have a lot of control over many different issues and mechanisms. And it\\'s shorter than most people would have you believe: our first game (with four players) lasted 3.5 hours. Not bad at all!  One word about the Valley Games visuals, though: butt ugly. And, most importantly, very difficult to tell apart. With proper graphics, this game would move even faster. As it stands, we spent way too much time squiting to see exactly what cards were defining the political orientations of every single player (all the way across the table...).  Played once, partially.  Once you start you can see how it\\'s a well-oiled machine, and the depth is ludicrous.  Eager to play again. [b]Purchase/Selling History[/b]:  My 2nd TANGA purchase \\'06. First played with friends at Janette\\'s house.  [b]Rating: 8.0[/b] [i]Design rating[/i]: [b]5[/b] (-.5) [i]Component rating[/i]: [b].5[/b] [i]Willingness to play rating[/i]: [b]1.5[/b] [i]Fun rating[/i]: [b]1.5[/b]  [b]Players considerations[/b]:  Hard to find 5 (sweet spot) players who are willing to put in the time, but if they know the rules and move fast, this isn\\'t any longer than many other games that hit the table much more.  [b]My thoughts[/b]:  After only a few plays, this game\\'s beauty and depth can be seen, well not really because you can\\'t even see the depths of the strategy contained within this game at first.  Very deep, balanced, and solid mechanics. Maybe my rating would go down with some plays, but it seems perfect. What an immense and amazing game, you\\'re never out of reach in this one and it goes all the way to the end, there\\'s so much involved in this game that its hard to figure it all out. Its fun too when you can find people to play and they\\'re fast moving, otherwise you don\\'t even get through a game before they want to stop playing and you\\'re left hanging. 3-5 players Personal likes and dislikes +Thematic and engrossing +Resource management and planning +Direct conflict -Long playtime -Rules heavy 3 plays. Very engaging game. It is long but you are repeating the same steps in the 7 areas. The final scoring should be taught first. Then the mechanics on how to play the game and what to do to score.  As good as everyone says.  Theme is not to my taste, but I still find this a great design.  It breaks my brain, but not in a frustrating way.  There are so many different choices you have to make, and almost every one is bound to make you sweat.  Just when you think you\\'ve got the money situation figured out, you realize that your meeting markers are limited, or once you manage to get the opinion poll, your opponent happens to have control of the media and can\\'t be touched.  There\\'s a lot here for you to manage, but none of it is irritating, and it all flows together seamlessly.  The fact that this game was originally released in 1986 boggles my mind.  The design is modern enough that it feels like it could have been released yesterday. A game about german politics. Brilliant theme, excellent execution. A lot of things going on, but really nothing too involved. Long for what it delivers, and needs a complete play to see the entire scope. However, the time flies and everyone is involved at every moment. At its best this game is like candy and very easy to become immersed in. \"Theme Theme Theme!\"  Our first game involved a cheater so was a major disappointment. He was later impeached and is currently living in poverty in Dusseldorf. Favorite game of German Elections.  Difficult to get into the first time, with experience it can be a brutal game of maneuvering for advantage. waiting to test as new game ---the heavy heavy !! Long, but good game.  Make sure you try and do as best you can in each one.  Get those regional cards to match your hand or your screwed.  Worry about the national one later and consider them bonus. Very good game which also manages to be true to its theme on mechanical level. Sure it\\'s complex but there isn\\'t much downtime. Despite this the gameplay is a bit too slow.  After just one game I can see where its fame comes from. It\\'s an amazing amalgamation of different parts that come together into an amazing whole. My kind of game! A real brain burner of a system that requires planning and constant attention. Finding players can be difficult but it rewards those who dare. Not as heavy as some make it out to be. German politics in a 5 hour board game?  Believe it or not this game is very fun.  I think every gamer has to play this at least once in their lifetime.  Probably one of the greatest mix of game mechanics out there. Players are trying to maximize their party\\'s political control in Germany. Elections are held in 7 regions. Each region resolves itself over 4 turns and is offset from the previous region by 1 turn. Regions are scored partly based on each party\\'s popularity there. Popularity is a dynamic graph similar to a stock chart. Players attempt to cash in their \"meetings\" when the graph is high so as to score as many votes as possible. This is complicated by the fact that players can change their party\\'s stand on the issues each turn, and by the fact that the stance of a region on the issues is only revealed one new issue per turn.  So you need to find a balance between your party\\'s issues and the 7 constantly (but slowly) changing regional issue sets. If you max out the current region which is about the hold the election, then you may have almost no sway at all in the next one. But maybe it\\'s worth it. Winning an election gives you a big boost on the national charts, and let\\'s you sway opinions... Fun game, now if only I could play an entire game with more than one person. Great game (but long).  There are a lot of stages to each turn.  The alliances really make this game interesting. Players represent different parties in the German political season. Finally got a 5p session in. Really like it. Can\\'t believe this game came out in 1986 - a Euro ahead of its time, still very solid now. Tons of little decisions (somewhat tactical in nature) that add up to a long term strategy? Lots of interaction, lots of ways to earn points, and not as long as we\\'d feared (about 4 hours total for our learning game, I think we can get that down to 3ish now that we know how to play).  Looking forward to more plays, possibly at BGGcon 2008. Rating may go up.  Not a lot of enthusiasm for playing this more, so I gifted it to a friend who wanted a copy.  Spielworxx reprint is available. Great game and very funny if you know the parties. Great theme, and the gameplay is deep and interesting.  I find it amazing this game was published in 1986. Ahead of its time is selling it short. There are a lot of mechanisms interacting together - beautifully. Everything makes sense thematically.  I think it might upset some gamers in that there are swings of fortune, that while planning can help, are beyond your control. In a four-hour game, I guess that could frustrate some people. But I found reacting to these changes the most fun part. It has the feel of political scrambling, which is great.   This game has so many multi-layered decisions and deep meaningful interaction with other players. Can\\'t say I will play this more than a handful of times in my life, but that\\'s OK. A classic. A truly excellent game. Don\\'t be intimidated by the length or complexity (even though what you\\'ve heard is probably true).  The game simulates multiple elections throughout different territories of Germany. There are five parties that must adjust their policies to match the public opinion, gain voters, and use media influence to win these elections.  I had a revelation while playing recently that instead of one, big, meaty game, it\\'s more like six meaty games being played simultaneously. I think in the future if I ever have the opportunity, that is how I would teach the game. The mechanics for each election are fairly straight-forward; it\\'s just the ability to affect four at a time that complicates things. Long, but surprisingly good political game.  There are seven regional elections in seven rounds.  You represent a German political party, and you win elections by matching your platform of issues with the regional attitudes.  You have opportunities to influence the media and populace by investing resources into a region.  Winners of the elections get cash and, more importantly, can influence the national agenda.  The player who has the most comprehensive and substantive alignment with the national agenda (determined by matching the national platform, size of party membership, and media presence) after the seventh round wins the game. I hate to say it, but I really like this game.  I seem to be more the typical \"Ameritrasher\" but this game is just plain good.  The only problem I have with it is collecting people willing to play... and the fact that my tagline is \"It\\'s a game about German politics... and you... get votes and control the medi........ you know what, nevermind.\" Incredibly ahead of its time. Still an engrossing, heavy gaming experience. I like this game, takes a while to play and for most of the game it\\'s not obvious if you are winning or not. Not sure if this is a weakness or strength. Fairly difficult to explain the rules , and this was to experienced gamers. Not sure if it was my explanation or the fact that they are mainly wargamers  A very good game of electoral politics from the german point of view. This is a great game, lots of fun with some real negotiation.  The simultaneous planning of the next 3 or 4 elections w/more and more information as time goes on is my favorite twist in the game.  It is a real juggling act.  It\\'s got a throw as many things to do at the same time vibe too, which is both fun but can be a bit trying and gimmicky.  It\\'s also a bit too long.  Overall, though, this comes highly recommended.    I used to give it a 10, but that was because I mostly only played eurogames and was measuring them against my limited euro experience.  Once I started to move into AT and wargames, I realized that eurogames are just plain not my thing.  This game is about as good and thematic as a euro gets to me, however.  Euros don\\'t get much better than this. Great game. Very long game.  Definitely for the hard core gamers, not for the weak or casual gamers.  Great mechanics.  I really do enjoy the game, it is just hard to play on a regular basis.  I wish someone would make \"Die Macher Express.\"  Got in 2007  2009 Plays = 1 2010 Plays = 1 2011 Plays = 2 eager to play this again  Remember for future games:  there are no coalitions in the 7th election, so play all 4 of your shadow cabinet cards with coalition telephone symbols on them in 4 of the first 6 election regions  When converting meeting marker cubes into votes you should leave one if you want the chance to convert again next round since you must have a minimum of 5 to do a conversion and you can only add up to 4 per region each round Finally got me a copy of this and proved that yes, Valley Games exists as one forum starter questioned. I suspect my rating could possibly rise as I get into this more. Surprisingly captivating game based (loosely) on the German political system. Seven regional elections are waged by up to five different political parties. Resources are devoted to generating political activity (meetings) influencing public opinion through the media and adjusting political platforms to reflect regional/national agendas. The winner is the one who steers his party most successfully through the maze of elements that make up this game. From the theme, you would think this game would have only limited interest, but it is so cleverly constructed that it captured me from the very beginning and, despite being a longish game, held my interest throughout. Excellent game, the longish playing time being the only negative! This game is one that I want to love.  But the actual play keeps on not living up to my expectations. By the end of the game I think that the winner has been determined by randomness. Well, not quite randomness, but by a confluence of events that were not directly controlled by the players.   I will play it for sure whenever the opportunity comes up, and I have yet to play a game of it where everyone is comfortable with the rules enough that it is actual play and not teaching...but for now this game takes a couple steps down on my podium of awesomeness.  This is one of my all-time favorites.  I can\\'t understand why the game length is a detractor for so many people.  If you are going to be playing games for a few hours....what is the difference between playing 3 shorter games and one fantastic game?  This game hits the sweet spot for me...providing negotiation and intrigue, tough decisions and requiring you to stay flexible.   Enjoyed my initial play of this legendary game.  The player aids on BGG are very useful to follow turn order.   Didn\\'t quite \"get all of it\" on the rules explanation, but I don\\'t think many would.  Check out the Board Games with Scott tutorial in the few days before you want to play so you will be prepared.  The 5p game I was involved in went a little long, but would play again while fresh in my mind. I\\'ve only played with four and five players.  Rich theme, lots to think about, forward planning and picking your fights essential.  A strong suspicion that an early success is vital to build momentum for the win.  The Valley Games edition is very good looking, my only criticism is that the icons for nuclear and economic development are too similar.  I kind of miss the politicians\\' heads on the shadow cabinet cards from the first edition. P I have the 2006 edition. I\\'ve played this a few times, now. It takes a long time to play, which is why I haven\\'t played it more often. A game on German politics...must be something of interest.  International Valley Games edition is coming in Aug 06.  Arrived at my house in Feb 07.  Heavy stuff.  The game is up to be played very soon.  After play, you won\\'t know this would be a 20-years old desgin as this is such an interactive game and everything affects everything. One slight move would have a huge impact on your long term strategy.  After all, who doesn\\'t want to have a landslide winning election in a major state?  The only downside is the level of abstraction is high to some people, making it difficult to \"click-in\" or dry after several playings.        Played this game a couple of time and really enjoyed it throught its extensive duration.  There\\'s a lot to cover in this game and I haven\\'t played enough to find a strategy that I want to adopt nor do I have a solid grasp on how to exercise mechanics to mitigate poor starting positions.Despite those issues, I really enjoy playing it. Interesting choices and actually pretty easy to play.  It\\'s pretty long, and I have an issue with the randomness of the very first round, you can get completely slaughtered if you have bad luck early, and never really get a chance to get back in it.  True for politics, but a bad idea for a game. A little too long. But definitely worth to play with group of gamers. Brutal, but worth it! Only to be played with gamer friends who can withstand the rules and dedicate the time (4hrs). I like the concept of political battles and swaying media and votes however its such deep system...I think i need to play much more.  Luckily, not nearly as difficult to figure out the rules after watching \"Boardgames with Scott\" doing a show on it at his website. Thanks Scott! One play (5).  Now I know what all the hype is about.  The game clocked in at 3.5 hours, but it didn\\'t seem to drag.  There is quite a lot to take in, but there seems to be a great balance between decisions.  Look forward to another play now that I have some clue as to how things work. Ultimately not the type of game I\\'ll play very long because of game length. I have enjoyed my 2 playings. Both were very enjoyable, immersive experiences. The shine has worn off: so much of it works so well together, but the last campaign of the game feels too important for a game of such length. A beautiful game with a wide set of interlocking mechanics. Sadly it\\'s also a rather long and involved game, so I\\'m afraid that it won\\'t see a lot of play with my group. Hat nem semmi a jatek szabalyrendszere. A szerzonek kulon gratulalok, hogy ennyire sikerult elbonyolitania. Az elso ket kor (osszesen 7 van) 4 ora alatt ment le. Hatarozottan jo a jatek, csak a kovetkezo jateknal mar olyanokkal szeretnek leulni akik mar jatszottak vele mert egy ujabb szabalymagyarazatot nem elnek tul (haboru es beke kismiska hozza kepest).

Ilyen esetben valoszinu a media fele kell fordulni, hogy a tartomanyban meglevo velemenyeket egy kicsit modositsa az ember, de sanos nem sikerult kihasznalni a kesoi felismeres miatt. Nem egy szulinapi zsurra szant jatek, az biztos. RATING 8   Based purely on playing 2 election rounds with 3 players.  I can see a heavily engaging 5 player game.  I also can see 4-5 hours going by very quickly.  Some of the scores from the session reports are similar to the closeness of the PR endgame.  You are in the game via a number of potential strategies.  Aggressive, coat-tailing, and spoiler are easy paths to take.  You don\\'t really need to plan ahead 4 elections, but you do need to plan for 3 ahead.  Game forces to think in the future!!  Gotta love the forced planned thinking element.  If you only want to worry about your turn, units, etc.  THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU.   DIE MACHER ist ein UBERSPIEL!  http://www.ronkkonen.com/boardgames.html#Macher Wow; very good game. Un juego que te gusta o lo odias, con una gran témática pero con gran complejidad, quizá excesiva... un quemacerebros para los muy cafeteros  The granddaddy. The grand ol patriarch. Deep and to be respected.  Great elections game. With the exception of the abominable card art(new edition), great game.  If played with knowledgeable and quick-ish players, completes in a very reasonable time frame. Check out BoardGameswithScott.com for an excellent video on how to play. I prefer the yellow Hans im Gluck 2nd edition to the 3rd edition Valley Games reprint with its confusing issue cards (some poor design decisions here - the defence, industry and nuclear power cards in particular). Some illustrations on the boards would also have made it look less abstract. Despite looking as dull as ditchwater this game is a fun experience but does have a lot of randomness in it (face down regional opinions, drawn cards for your party platform, poll cards, rolling for party membership) so doesn\\'t necessarily reward good play. A rule for awarding points for money at the end of the game needs to be incorporated otherwise the last auction just goes to the richest player (dividing by DM5,000 and rounding down would be about right). I love games about politics, and this one is by far the best I\\'ve played.  It may be too long for most people, but when you get five people together the chaos that ensues makes it worth it. A load of fun. The length is just too long to make it a game you pull out regularly, but is still very reasonable, which I think adds to the mystique of this game, since it feels like a special treat. Unfortunately got destroyed in move (mould) Almost too much to handle. An event game. I feel the need to schedule a playing at least once per year. Tentative rating after 2 plays.  Amazing!  Bought at Essen 2007. Provisional rating after 1st play. Very good but complex and long, so won\\'t get it on the game table that much. Die Macher is a good time, though very involved.  With my typical game group, we can play through the game in 2.75 - 3 hours. A rich experience with lots of room for strategic planning. Valley Games, 3rd edition. Everything is in fantastic condition. Played a few times, but plenty of score sheets remaining on the pad. Tons of various player aids printed out from BGG.   In this edition, the \"economic development\" and \"nuclear power\" cards look incredibly similar to each other, especially across the table. To rectify this, I put tiny yellow sticker dots on all the \"nuclear power\" cards, making the game much more playable. They can easily be removed if you wish, or colored in with a little radiation symbol (my original intention), or used just fine as is.   Comes from a smoke-free, pet-free home. Game ID #1 on BGG and still in Top 50 more than 25 years after its release; Die Macher is a modern classic. Now only Samurai remains to be played from last millenium\\'s  German Top 100 Games. Die Macher stands out from this group (El Grande, Taj Mahal, Princes of Florence, Goa etc.) with its length, complexity and unusually high direct interaction. Its procedural nature vaguely reminds me of Avalon Hill games from the same time period. Other than that, gameplay is \\'Euro\\' with area majority, auctions and a restricted random factor. In sum, it\\'s a crossover game between Ameritrash and Eurogames from a time when neither term was coined. It\\'s the Dominant Species of German politics. Spielworxx did a great job with the Limited Edition- they streamlined Die Macher down to a 2.5-3 hour experience and in the process polished some of the rough edges that made the original feel dated. After a handful of plays I can confirm this has pretty much fired previous versions and happily now Die Macher hits the table more often than it ever did before!  Die Macher is a lot like El Grande in that there is little you can completely control- you have to roll with the punches and identify where you can get away with not being undermined. Unlike El Grande, there is a strong focus on long term planning- you can not only see but also affect elections several rounds into the future. This is a wonderful game of grand strategy with virtually no downtime between turns; just an incredibly engrossing and fun experience. I really enjoyed my one play of this game. It\\'s not nearly as complicated as it seems to be at first. Great game. It’s not something I’d play every week because of the time commitment, every once in a while is best. It’s meaty – there are lots of phases to each round, which are all easy to understand individually but harder to comprehend how they work together. After a round or two you get the hang of how it works, but it takes longer to work out what the best tactics are. But even if you don’t know what you’re doing, it’s still really fun because it’s so well themed. Surprising as it may sound, running a German political party is actually very entertaining! You can control the media, manipulate public opinion, accept bribes (or refuse them and take the moral high ground), form coalitions with other players to gang up on another party, it’s quite realistic.  A game of heavy series politics. This game really captures the feeling of parlamentar democracy, with constant changes of official opinions to attract more voters. Complex game that is time manageable now thanks to the \"short-game\" rules. Rules are very clear, and easy to understand. It is the interaction of all the phases and putting them together into a winning strategy that will melt your brain (in a good way.) See my session report for more details and first impressions.   After two plays I like this game a lot, but the game hinged almost entirely on one election each time.  I suspect this is because we played the fast rules both times.  I look forward to raising my rating after trying the full rules. Contemplative 5 hour mind bender--  Good lord how to improve my platform and shore up Breman... Oh wait! there are media counters to place and votes to buy...  ahhh Maybe I can force a coalition and ride the leader home for a few more points...  This is the ulitmate tricky game with a slow and grinding progress...This game is a very easy game in many ways but takes a lot of time. Seems to be worth the legendary fame. Lots of rules but they offer a lot to play with.  There was two years between my first and second game. In that time I had forgotten almost every possible rule that there was to forget. I think this is the biggest flaw of the game. There is so many little or big things you should be aware during playing. If you can get this played at least twice every year this might not be a problem but I\\'m not sure if I\\'m able to do it. This is bigger problem of the player rather than the game. The game is very good. I\\'d been wanting to play this game for a long time, and when I finally got the chance, I wasn\\'t disappointed. There\\'s so much going on and a lot to think about, but it all fits with the theme, and after a couple of rounds the rules make sense, though it\\'s still difficult to know what to do for the best outcome. The game is long, but it doesn\\'t feel that long, as each election is exciting and there\\'s much anticipation going into each round. Long-term plans are a must. You have to focus on just some of the elections into which to pour your resources, while trying to eke out what you can from the others on minimal investment. My biggest problem was forgetting that I had a limited number of cubes to place. I won the game, but I won only two elections (one in a coalition that was forced on me), but I also scored a full 50 on another (but was beaten by a coalition). I had way more party membership than anyone else, which is what gave me the win. Winning the first election helped, too, even though it was the smallest of the game (26 seats, of which I got only 13 or so) because it gave me early positioning on the national board, which turned into lots of points through matched policies and media control. Wee hoo!  I got this one from my Secret Santa for Christmas 2006.  (OK, I opened it early -- mea culpa.) (3-5) - 240 Min. Just as long as Twilight Imperium, but cleaner. Great game that probably takes to0 long to justify getting it out all that often.  I really enjoyed playing it, though.  Looking forward to the next time. A somewhat heavy game that is a lot of fun in the right crowd. Politics has never been this much fun. A must own. Very involved game that does take a lot of time but is engaging.  Initial rating after playing with 5 new people in the shorter version. A very good game indeed.  If I went strictly by the BGG rating system, though, I\\'d have to rate it lower; I could certainly see myself turning down a 5-hour game.  But I always enjoy playing and, given the time, I would happily play this anytime. Only played this once, should try and get a second play to see whether it\\'s as good as I thought the first time. Played with people who already know the rules, and played quickly, this is a game I would almost always be willing to play. There is almost no downtime as each player makes many small decisions concurrently with each other to move through the 11 (11!), but tiny, phases of the turn. And, each decision matters and can have a bad word inducing impact on the other players - no multi-player solitaire here. I wouldn\\'t want to play the game all the time - it\\'s mentally taxing - but I\\'ll still look forward to seeing it hit the table again sometime in the future.   It takes time to come to grips with the many and varied moving parts that is the engine called Die Macher. It\\'s what I imagine trying to fly a helicopter would be like - every adjustment affects some other system which then needs to be adjusted, which affects another system, and so on.... An exhausting but thoroughly entertaining ride. My favourite political game. My hands-down favorite of the long, complicated class of games. I like its balance between control and chaos -- seems like real politics to me. I know a lot of people complain about the public opinion polls \"breaking\" the game, but I see them as just one more variable you must account for in your planning. After my 10+ plays, I\\'m convinced that the game is won or lost by Shadow Cabinet cards and careful coalition management. Great german one! A piece of history for eurogames. You\\'ll find a lot of interaction and several way to push your strategy. Difficult to manage during the first games, but a must for avanced players who like euro style. I was little sceptic about Die Macher, but it turned out to be just amazing. I thought that game would be too long (about 4 hours) for me, but I was wrong. So many decicions to do during the game and only little downtime.   Rules were pretty easy to understand. Beautiful game of politics and elections. Good mechanics and I really love the theme. Wonder if anyone will ever make a version for the polticial and electoral systems of other countries? A very hard game to teach to other players, but I really like it.  I\\'m unsure how much it reflects actual German politics, but as an abstract election game, it really works.  Time is again a factor as it takes a very long time (4-6 hours) to finish a game. Buen juego, pero bastante frío. Rating based on 1 play. My favorite heavy euro because I was not bogged down in AP and math computations when I played it. The mechanics should be lauded by all, as you must take into consideration so many possibilities.  Only gripe is that a pasted on theme annoys me in political games. This is one of those \"Huh—is that all there is?\" games.  If you look at the action that takes place on a single board across a single turn, it\\'s really a lot simpler than it looks.  What bulks the game up into hulking-behemoth-of-German-gaming status is the fact that you\\'ll be playing on four boards simultaneously across seven rounds.  Much in the a same way that a full game of Go is more than just four 9x9 games at the same time, a full game of [i]Die Macher[/i] will bend your head to its outer limits as you attempt to do the cognitive push-pull on a bazillion cardboard levers for five hours.  I don\\'t feel qualified to throw an official rating on it after just one play; unofficially I\\'d give it a 7 or an 8—I\\'m not really sure right now.  I was underwhelmed at first by the idea that it was just many iterations of the same mechanics over and over with little variation.  I find myself, however, unable to stop thinking about it, much like after finding out the homely girl in your eighth grade class is a fantastic kisser...  It definitely loses points for the fact that it takes five hours and requires a quorum of five players who get all frothy at the idea of spending an entire afternoon LARPing German electoral politics.  I\\'d like to play it several more times to get a better idea of exactly how I feel about it, but that\\'s going to be hard to do more than once a year or so.  Perhaps I\\'ll have an answer within the next five years.  See you then.   UPDATE:  Had a better handle on things after a second play, but since it took place a year after the first one, it still felt like a learning game.  On the theme side I really love how cynical (and realistic) the game is:  instead of having the different parties take principled stances on issues, everyone is fighting for the middle, flip-flopping like crazy to maximize vote count. I have played this game a half-dozen times now, and it is a very strong experience. I personally prefer the \"shorter game\" variant described in the Valley Games version of the game, because I don\\'t find that the mid-game suffering overwhelms the benefit of a shorter game. Like Puerto Rico, this game requires a number of pays before you can begin to get a grip on the ways you can effectively mitigate your risk, and like PR, it requires that you play with people of similar experience for best results. I like it with four and five, but there are folks in my group who do not like to play this with anything but five. Excellent, excellent game.  There is more luck then you\\'d expect but it doesn\\'t bother me, since I already feel too much in the game is calculable.  The only problem I have with this game is the length.  If it were a bit shorter (and thus easier to throw into a real world scehdule) my rating would be a 9.5. A real political election, wonderful game mechanics.   Valley Games edition An excellent game of political decision making. Really fun game and pretty good simulation of a regional proportional representation. OK... I understand now. I\\'m not sure I\\'ll play it more than 4 or 5 more times in my lifetime, but I get why people love this game so dang much.  Board Games With Scott does an amazing job explaining the rules - it is ESSENTIAL viewing before you play. This game is nice because it handles a theme that most games would not dare to handle: politics. If you like politics, you like really heavy german-games, and you\\'re willing to sit down 3 to 4 hours, die Macher is the absolute game to play! If any of the previous requisites do not apply to your game group; don\\'t play die Macher ;).  A Awesome game!  Eurogame 3-5 duro. Listax2 Sounded very complicated, plus I can\\'t read German. But no matter, as once you start playing it becomes easily understandable, plus everything is picture based so no German is needed (sorry Hans!). This game plays well, and apart from an unlimited amount of possible votes/seats is a very good representation of the mechanics of politics. Highly  enjoyable, and although competitive not a game you can loose friends over! Very good game in which strategy, planning and tactics all play their part. Nice atmosphere. May be a bit long for some people. Just bought, haven\\'t played yet, hopefully will soon.  Update 9-30-08: Finally played for the first time, it was a lot of fun but even the shortened version took 4 hours. Wow, just wow.  What an awesome Euro!  The games feels like a 10 for me, but since I\\'ve only played it twice, I don\\'t want to go overboard.  So I\\'ll start with an 8.  Played this my first time at Fire & Ice Con in 2008.   Love the longer term planning involved in the game.  This is an Epic Euro!    This game has a lot of mechanics that are easy to learn by the first or second round.  However, it took me the whole game to start to see the strategy involved.  I lost miserably both times playing this, but am more than willing to go at this again and again.  My first game with four players (two new) took us four hours.  Seems like that is about how long a 5 experienced players would take so I\\'m more than willing to go at this again.   Wish there where more people that I know that like this one as much as I do.  Seems like I\\'ll only get this one played at conventions.  Need to play this one with Doug. The game is excellent - each part of the game, as it is played, is easy to understand but the inter-relationships between actions are fascinating. Thee game is highly interactive.  I initially felt, as I looked at the rules that the game would be difficult to play as there were so many icons, but as you play you discover you don\\'t need to know the meaning of the icon as it serves no useful purpose in connection with the game play. Great game, 6-8 hours is too long. As boring as the theme sounds, this is actually an interesting and fun game.  Once you see how the mechanics fit together it breezes by. What a game...  It feels like you are on a train barerreling down towards the election.  You have control of course but it doesn\\'t feel like it.  In the end it works... and its fun. Heavy Euro.  Hard to believe this game was published in 1986. I imagine it will be considered a classic, as it is that good! Theme fits well with the mechanics.  Drawback is the length and learning curve.  Almost no downtime for any player--engaging throughout.  So many strategies and ways to victory.  Fun, exciting game! Unfortunately, it won\\'t get played as often because of the barrier to introduce it based off of the theme and length.  I have a niftly flip-book (printed off from a great file here on BGG) of the various phases which helps the game run along quite smoothly. Heaviest game I\\'ve played so far.  Wow.  That was something.  I really enjoyed it.  It was like watching a beautiful machine hum and see the cogs moving.  Man, it took a long time to teach and play.  Played smoothly and didn\\'t seem to drag at all.  Print out Liumas\\'s player aids before playing! The only reason I don\\'t rate this game higher is because of it\\'s lack of accessibility -- not that the mechanics are really too overwhelming, but the components, presentation, and game length leave non-gamers running for the door. Stunning mechanics though: this game deserves it\\'s high rating. First game with 5 players. Die Macher is certainly a well-themed game; it really does feel as though you are running an election campaign, although it is a shame that the parties are only differentiated by their name and colour. The game seems to work well, with the only downsides being the length and the role of chance. The rather excessive duration is due to there being a lot of mechanics for a eurogame, the time players spend calculating how many votes the other players could potentially win in the upcoming (and future) elections, and generally the need for a considerable amount of planning. The role of chance is most gratuitous in the opinion poll cards, though the use of dice for calculating changes to party membership also seems unnecessary.  Good game. It\\'s just so very very long. Quite good political game.  I think the only thing that prevents a higher rating is the games extremely long length.  If a first time player, set aside 5-6 hours, as the rules will likely take an hour by themselves. Complex interlocking game mechanics are highly intuitive. A well-crafted gem. Has a lot of moving parts, so it is hard to explain and get started but once you\\'ve played a few rounds you see how the game flows. Definitely get some of the player aids with what happens on each turn so one player can \"drive\" the rounds.  The game has a good tradeoff between taking advantage of the current position and planning ahead. It is good to see how you can position yourself for future actions.  Great decsions on where to put your resources - media, faction members and when to cash in those members for votes - there are tradeoffs to release them for other use and current board position. Your balance between the issues of importance to your party versus the local, versus the national, making coalitions, setting up your national strength - all in all a very rich game.   All the fun of German Politics - all in one board game! Definitely a deep strategy game - only tried a 5 round intro game so far, but it was enjoyable - a lot of paths that can be taken here! Complexity turns a lot of people off, but I love it.  Don\\'t be fooled into thinking this is a pure Euro just because there aren\\'t any guns and it was designed by a German.  There are lots of moving parts, from resource management to a minor area-control aspect to negotiation.  The penalties for not winning regions outright are large enough to be significant, but not so large as to make the second-place finisher feel as though nothing was accomplished.  I\\'m the only one I know who views the theme as a positive aspect of the game.  The game does take around five hours to play a full 7 rounds, but I don\\'t find it as brainburning as its reputation suggests.  It\\'s not a dreary mathematical exercise at least, and a lot of fun to play during an election season.  After 5 plays I\\'m moving this rating down to 8.  The theme is still top-notch but the more I play the less convinced I am the game results are meaningful. I have valley games international edition. This is a place holder for the update scheduled for 2018/2019.   A rich and elegant game mechanic that keeps you captivated to the end.  I am so happy I own Die Macher and I am even happier when I can convince four other players to try it out, even after I tell them it is a game about German politics.  But once introduced to it, every new player has always been quite fond of it as well. Only one game so far, and while I did poorly (less than half the final score of what the winner achieved) I do want to play again. A second game played and I still lost, but was behind the winner by only as many points as I\\'d been behind fourth in my first game. It is important to be involved in almost everything it seems, which can be frustrating for how you get to spread resources. It\\'s not always wise to accept a coalition either, I basically gave an opponent points by agreeing to his offer in one of the elections.  Would rate higher if not for the time required. Valley Games edition. AGoS math trade. Waiting to play. Like new.  Yup, this is a really heavy game, all right.  I think if it were first published today it would probably be split up into at least two games and maybe more.  It\\'s a rather difficult balancing act with lots of rules and many repercussions for every decisions that you must make, but all of the different aspects of the game fit together so well that it is a very worthwhile experience and I am certainly looking forward to playing it again.  I can\\'t begin to explain what the game is mechanically *like* in this space so I will just direct you to BGWS, but let me just say that it is both mechanically interesting and thematically appropriate. (1 play) Me and some friends played our first game of Die Macher last night during the Swedish elections :)  We unfortunately had to cut the game short at 01:00 as people had to go to work this morning and the rule reading took much longer than anticipated.  I really liked this game but it was hard to get an overview of all that was going on so the strategies were so so on my part. I did win but that was more luck than skill no doubt.  The one big complaint: The graphics on the cards are useless in my edition of the game. Some are very hard to distinguish from others and that makes the overview process even more painful.  Final thoughts: I need to play this game again and to learn it well enough to start strategizing :P Then I might also bump it up to a 9 :) Everyone\\'s favourite game about German politics! Love the politics.  3rd edition I loved this game the once I played it but it\\'s a bit too long to be able to fit in a normal gaming evening. would love to play again. A great game. Takes a long time to play however.  Some heavy games you want to play every chance you get. Die Macher, on the other hand, seems like a once-or-twice a year ritual.   Good game. Can be hard to remember all the various ways to score points and to internalize the sequence of 15 phases (or however many there are). Made a lot more sense to me on my second play, and that was after a full year had passed.   Update: with the release of Dominant Species, I\\'m beginning to wonder about \"stepwise\" games with 15+ mini-phases to go through each round. It just seems to over-determine the approach. None of my favorite games have anything resembling this, and it\\'s made me weary of trying otherwise intriguing games like The Dutch Revolt. I want to take my turn, not check in for 2 seconds during step 11.  liegt bei timo gifted Great multifacet game.  One cannot win if just concentrating in one side of the game.  I like the way players interact together.  There is so much to think, it\\'s like the brain is melting.  I love that sensation in a game.  Thumbs up Finally picked this up, but I don\\'t know if I\\'ll ever get my group to play it. Finally I got to play Die Macher, the grumpy old grandfather of modern Euros. With the optimal 5 players and it was a fun group too...  Considering Die Macher was published in \\'86, much in it still feels fresh. A bit procedural though, the owner of the copy was \"game master\" and was using the \"check list\" to keep us going through steps and phases in the right order. In a modern design, steps and turns are usually more intergrated in the game visually on the board he thought, and I think he is right.  A \"heavy\" game, at least for me, and it took me almost 2 elections before I had sorted out all the details. Managed to squeeze out a win by doing extremly good in the last region (a 80 point election).  Give it an 8 for now, could definitely rise with more plays. A long game for sure, and a bit dry, but still thematic and very engaging. Played the \"Valley games\" edition, some of the icons on the cards were confusingly similar..   Perfect but quite long. It looks dry, and it maybe is a bit, but this is one hell of a game. Well balanced, you have to think ahead, pick your battles (there\\'s not any real battles). Despite hating real politics, I really love this game. I would rate this higher if it didn\\'t require at least 5 hours to complete. It can be complex, but it\\'s a good brain workout - only perhaps not for the faint-hearted.  When I bought it backk in the early nineties, none in my group wanted to play it. But me, I always found, this is a brilliant game. Though very, very long... One of the earliest euros I ever played.  Maybe it is why I love the heavy stuff so much. Yep, this is definitely one of the longer and more complex euros I\\'ve ever played. On the whole the game is good. There\\'s a lot of interaction between different elements, and there\\'s a minor bit of chaos to keep things from becoming predictable. I do worry about the significance of the final election, which can cause huge swings in the national party VP\\'s.  There are a couple rules oddities and production issues. Why are there two types of positions for each issue if they\\'re the same in practice? Why do coalition members get to undo their partner\\'s federal stance? But, these are minor annoyances.  In the future I would only play the short game if any of the players were newbies. Playing with people who have played it just once before drastically reduced our playing time. An awesome game that is well worth the investment of time.  First play (not counting a dummy round to get everyone on the same page) took four and a half hours, which is shorter than I had expected. I would never have thought a political game would be remotely as interesting as Die Macher. This game makes me reconsider my ratings for other games.  Amazing game... to bad it takes such a long time because it is so much fun! It frightens me... I finally played this at a group gaming event! There are so many things to remember but I had a lot of fun with this one. Not sure if my copy will ever get played though. Pretty enjoyable.  My rating may change the next time I play, since we neither understood what we were doing, nor were playing it correctly.  Even so, we have a pretty good time, and it\\'s a pretty fun game once you understand what you\\'re doing.  Kind of slow moving, and a little more complex than it probably needs to be, but nothing extremely bad about it. There is so much going on here it kinda makes my head hurt. I would love to play this again but its length and the 5p requirement makes it hard to get to the table. There does seem to be a bit too much randomness for a 5hr game but hey, that\\'s definitely thematic. 2006 edition A magnificent blend of mechanics that all interact with each other in subtle ways.  A lot more straight-forward than its reputation would suggest, too.   365 in 365ed [floatleft][ImageID=980032][/floatleft][b][u]Initial Impressions:[/u][/b] If you had told me when I was a teenager that I would love playing a five hour game about German politics, I would have told you that you were crazy. Now I am the crazy one...   [b][u]What I like:[/u][/b]  [b][u]What I dislike:[/u][/b] The only real downside to Die Macher is finding willing players to dedicate the 4+ hours to playing one game.  [b][u]Overall:[/u][/b]   #### Great game. A bit...confusing at first. There are a lot of \\'moving parts\\' to it, and it\\'s hard to keep track of them all. But I loved it.  I think the only reason I don\\'t rate it higher is the length.  The game is enough of a \\'brain-burner\\', that 3.5 hours seems like a very long time. Hasselhoff: Nachtrider, or Hasselhoff: Baywatchen   Bratwurst: Ja, or Bratwurst: Ja Ja!!  Pool Parties: Ja, or Pool Parties: Nein  These are just some of the issues that comprise this amazing game about German politics. Despite the loooong playtime and dry theme, Die Macher is an outstanding game.  My wife has not played it, but I am 100% confident that she would hate it. One of my favorite games.  I need to think of a better way to convince people to play this game.  An absolute gem.  The card graphics need work so I\\'ve actually made my own cards that can only help with game play. Only played this once, but what a great game.  So much depth.  Our group had a lot of conversation about the game before and after the session.  I look forward to playing it again. Need to play more. This game is so Great! The theme is kinda meh (what could you expect? Just political battle of German parties), but the mechanics are so great. No other game like it, the interwoven mechanics cannot be compared by other games. Truly brain burning and as nasty as politics. I\\'ve only played this a handful of times, but there\\'s so much going on, but almost all of it is profoundly meaningful. Finally got a play in of this game.  It was not nearly as complicated as I anticipated but it does run about 4 hours if you play the full 7 rounds.  We only played the shortened 5 round version, so I think I would enjoy it even more if I tried the full version. New I\\'ve only played it once, but [i]Die Macher[/i] is the meatiest game that I would love to play again. As far as rules go, it\\'s not really that hard; there\\'s just a lot to remember as there are a lot of phases. But it\\'s a brain-burner when it comes to tracking all the interactions that are going on.  The experience itself was not as awesome as I was anticipating; I wanted to come away feeling [i]Die Macher[/i] is the game of the century. But, it fell a bit flat.  I would have enjoyed it more had the others learned the rules in advance. I spent more time explaining things and shepherding them along from one phase to the next than I did analyzing my situation. Nevertheless, I\\'m looking forward to having another go at it as it\\'s definitely a game with plenty of depth.  This has the potential to become one of my favorites. A great strategy game where you have to plan ahead and focus your resources to reach your goals. Brilliant German game. 9b A wargame-eket nem számítva az ismertebb (legalább 30 szavazatot kapott) játékok közül a második legnehezebb játék jelenleg a Die Macher a BGG-n(a Magic Realm után). Ezek tudatában már kb. 1 éve készültem kipróbálni a szekrényben lapuló példányt, nagyon kíváncsi voltam, miben rejlik a nehézsége. Emellett szerettem volna megismerni már csak amolyan általános műveltségi okokból is ezt a legendás darabot. A szabályból már sejtettem, hogy nem lesz könnyű. Kb. 1 órámba telt ismertetni a többiekkel. Nem rövid a szabály, de a komplexitást nem a szöveg hosszúsága adja, hanem az, hogy minden mindennel összefügg, és ebből rettentő bonyolult döntési helyzetek adódnak. A játék taktikai elemek tömkelegét is kínálja (egyszerre befolyásolni tudunk akár 4 különböző időpontban kiértékelődő választást is), de az eredmény a nemzet táblán dől el végérvényesen, oda pedig stratégiai gondolkodás is szükséges. Mindenre van válaszlépés, minden számításunkat keresztül tudnak húzni, van olyan akció, amit 3 féle módon is végre lehet hajtani (pl. médiabefolyás szerzése). A szerencsefaktort a kockák ellenére igen csekélynek érzem. Nem tudom, hány parti kellene, hogy tudatosan felépítve tudjam játszani, de elsőre örültünk, hogy a szabályokat helyesen tudtuk alkalmazni. Igazi brutál hardcore gémer játék, szerintem aki kicsit is komolyan társasjátékozik, egyszer próbálja ki:) Elrettentő lehet, hogy a játék témája a politika (Németországban kell választást nyerni a pártunkkal), de szerintem pont az a jó a a játékban, hogy a témához tényleg nagyon kötődik, megpróbálja nagyon pontosan a valós dolgokat lemodellezni. Egyrészt emiatt, másrészt a kora miatt (1986-os) nagyon egyedi, nem a mai divatos mechanizmusok köszönnek vissza benne, igazi unikumnak tekintkthető. A nagyon erős mechanizmust talán csak a téma szárazsága húzza le kicsit, meg a hosszú játékidő, de szerintem néhány parti után igazán élvezetes lehet.  A játék kivitelezése profi, a tábla és a kártyák is tökéletesen nyelvfüggetlenek.  Röviden összefoglalva: kiugró darab, de az erőssége (komplexitás) egyben a gyengesége is:)  Játszanék még vele! Very much enjoyed this game. Feels like a game that couldnt be designed now (so many different phases!) but actually quite easy to understand once it got going. G I did not expect to like this one as much as I did.  I want to play it again/more! We\\'ve played twice now, and if you have a group of players that likes Euro games this is a safe bet for you.  {     \"min_duration\": 210,     \"max_duration\": 300,     \"players\": [4,5] } Possibly the best political game there is.  This rating should not be taken as a sign that I am keen to play. (F4) Very fun game; not hard to understand the basic concepts and in general a very cool experience. Very thematic. The downsides are the length of the game, and that it\\'s hard to distinguish among the different preference cards... Hans in Gluck version: I have finally found the time and opportunity to play the first game on The Geek. After the first round when everyone was finding their feet with the game it moved forward much faster than I was expecting and the rounds completed in about 20-30 minutes (with 4 players). The game is highly interactive and you have to be aware of everything going on around you, so game play is intense. The game itself is not particularly difficult to learn or \"heavy\" but it is very involving. I\\'m looking forward to a second play! Brilliant. Again, lots of fun with the right people - geeky. Recommend some house rules to force people to stick to 2 or 3 core policy positions throughout the game. Doesn\\'t make sense for the Greens to flip from pro green energy to anti, several times during an election, just to secure some votes... CDL This game is a solid classic.  When we played we got a rule wrong which eliminated me from contention, so I would love to play this again with the correct rules.  I have only played with 3 so a 4 player games should come next. Really really enjoyed our first game of this.  In a 3 player game the scores ended 415, 411, 409...that was a great nail biting introduction to the game!  It took a round or two to understand all the symbols and how they fit together with the turn sequence, but once we had it the pace picked up and it flowed really well. :tobacco: :( :( :what: :) :D If \"being actually entertaining for the entirety of its playing time\" is a decent heuristic for rating a game that runs close to four hours, than Die Macher is worthy of a pat on the back. There\\'s little downtime in this joint, and a lot of room for clever play. The theme (state-level parliamentary elections in Germany -- yay?) may be a turnoff for some but I loves me some politics-as-theme.  My maiden voyage with Die Macher left me with a less than savory taste in my mouth; the possibility exists, especially with new players, of the game (four hours, recall) being decided by one player being overly generous to another and in so doing throwing it to him/her. This happened in this case. Not sure how you [i]avoid[/i] that in a game that is by necessity highly interactive, complex in multiple dimensions, and multi-player. Obviously good play will reduce the extent to which people blatantly (but inadvertently) spike the wheels.  My instinct after playing was to compare it to Dominant Species, which is a mechanically different game but has a similar play time, similar level of complexity and the same tension between taking actions that will be of immediate benefit in the near term vs. taking actions that will be resolved in the more distant future -- actions which are more speculative (because less information), but also with a higher risk-reward amplitude (again because less information and more opportunity for your fellow players to mess with you.)  It\\'s worth noting (but probably not worth having a cow over) the fact that the graphic design of the Valley Games edition is marred by some inexcusably terrible choices -- setting aside the use of Comic Fucking Sans for everything, the real sin is the muddy, indistinct, similar looking icons for things that are supposed to be seen quickly on small cards when viewed from across a table. If only there was some clear, distinct, immediately noticeable, more or less universally recognized icon that connoted \"nuclear power.\" That would be terrific. One I like to play solo. Too much like real politics, with a lot of flip-flopping. I think the mechanics are, while complex, tactically good, and the victory conditions are difficult to play towards. Classic Eurogame... this puts all the new eurogames to shame.  I can\\'t belive how well thought out this game is.  All the mechanics have a counter balance and players can\\'t score in all areas well.  It does run a bit long, but it is worth the effort to play. After 2 and a half games, I really enjoy Die Macher. It\\'s easily one of the best games in its class, and I really like how it uses the various design philisophies of Eurogames to it\\'s advantage. You are usually engaged in something, there\\'s a lot of balance in different actions, scarcity of actions and money is a factor, and each round is broken into over a dozen steps. But it flows very well with a little experience, and the result is one of the deepest, most rewarding games around. It\\'s very long, but if you block out the time and someone knows how to teach, you can make an evening of it with no problem. It takes some effort to learn and play, but if you can find the time, this is highly recommended. Awesome policitcal game, the game time flies by tough choices abound. [1 play] I could see rating this a 10 and I could also rate it a 6 or 7. Let me explain.   10 for the amazing way this game keeps everyone pretty well occupied downtime free for 5 or 6 hours, and 10 for the wonderful blend of mechanics (published 25 years ago, hello!?) offering layer upon layer oflayerlayerlayer of crazy strategic possibilities.  7 (or maybe 6) for the huge doses of luck that hop in occasionally without warning, which is a bit shocking in a game of this length. 7 or 8 for the honest reflection that I want to limit the frequency of gaming where I play monster length games multiplayer, so by the bgg ratings dogma it can\\'t be a 9 or 10 since I don\\'t want to play it all the time, maybe more like once or twice per year.  Most recent play 2-25-12 with Donovan, Garrett, Corey, and Michael. Finally played this game. It is very interesting and there are a lot of moving parts. The amount of influence is great when bidding correctly and using your media pawn and shadow cabinet correctly. You need to closely watch what to other players are doing and adapt to / plan for that. Great game (despite the theme :-)) played: 4 The BIG 1 - not the the big Red 1, mind you- this is a legendarily long euro, with complicated mechanics, a lot of long-range planning, a fair amount of interactive screw-age, and a great deal of involvement for players at all times in the game.  All of this is true, but it also has some luck, and relies on optimal action timing to use the limited resources as best as one can to optimize final placement.  After a learning play, I can attest that the many reputations are well-earned, and in fact I would say the only reasons this isn\\'t still in the top 50 are: # Players, Length of game, Availability (currently OOP again).  This game is terrific. It certainly IS a cube pusher, but the tight resource availability, the limited scope of change over time, the thematic depth, and the general involvement at all parts of the game combine to make this a true blue ribbon game (even in the VG 3rd edition).  It\\'s hard to throw out a number, but I am starting this terrific euro-monster at an 8. (That makes Die Macher: (i) equal to the best of Uwe Rosenberg, (ii) the 2nd best \\'new to me\\' game played in 2012, (iii) just on the brink of my personal top 10, (iv) higher rated than I place 7 of the top 10 games on BGG.)  If ever a game deserved a(nother) reprint, with the best graphics, it is this one. It is still one of the best Euros out there, without question. Amazing game, but too long to play often. Muy duro, todo encaja perfectamente. Una obra de arte This is an EPIC game! I expected it to feel at least a bit dated, given both the year it was produced and that games, in general, keep getting more refined over the years as designers build on what works and get rid of mechanics that don\\'t. I was surprised to find that this is pretty much perfect.    We played a 5 1/2 hour game with 5 players which is a true tribute to our teacher, since three of us were new to the game. (You rock, Melissa!).  It didn\\'t feel like five hours at all - THAT\\'S how engaging the game is.  I made mistake after mistake, but had a blast!   Very interesting and unique game. Wow, 1st play of this and loved the way the game round worked with the ability to influence up and coming elections 3 turns later with playing of the minister cards as well as the voting tokens and all important media cubes. Can\\'t wait to get another go of this but it is a very long game and we only played the short version. Hoping to go all the way to 7 at next game. One of the best designed games I have ever played. This is an experience though that needs to be committed to. PILE OF SHAME Looks amazing. Working my way through the rules now. Excelente juego, me encanto definitivamente todo el proceso electoral....coaliciones, etc...  Muy buen juego...es largo, es cierto, pero da frutos la estrategia a futuro. OK, so I can say I have played it. Over an hour for the rules and a further 5 hours to play but I have played it. To be fair, second time out it might only be 3-4 hours total. It is a very good, very heavy game with rather more chaos than you might expect for a game this long and intense. Ultimately however, there are games which give you exactly the same in 2-3 hours on first play so I would rather play two of those than one of this - can\\'t see myself rushing back to this one. One of the best long/heavy games of all time. Recreates the German political process; but clever game design means that all players are involved at all times (no waiting an hour while one player takes their turn, like some big/heavy games). This might have been the first \"big\" game I ever played. It\\'s really awesome though. This game really nails the theme of being a campaign manager. So many things to think about on your turn and you really feel the stress of having far too many needs and far too few resources.  You\\'re a campaign manager for a German political party. You must decide where and how to spend resources.  Do you spend resources getting more votes in the current state, or on a future state?  Do you spend resources to sway the wants of a state to match those of your party? Played this for the first time recently.  Loved the game, despite the old and somewhat clunky mechanics.  The Opinion Poll cards were often the time of furious bidding, usually to mitigate against a potentially bad poll, and this element of chance is something I\\'d like to see updated in a new version of the game. # Players: 3-5 Like a good wine, this game gets better with each play.  Art and graphics are sorely dated however, with its tight design, Die Macher definitely deserves a re-print! 3-5 players with lots of variants. Kickstarter arrived 21st February 2020. A wargamers Euro. Enjoyed the one play. Look forward to trying at player count > 3. Very old game, a bit outdated, long, but fun if you don\\'t mind cut-throat competition. obv 1x spelen. Zie BSM voor korte review. A wonderfully thematic Euro with a smorgasbord of fun, interdependent levers to play around with. Scoring opportunities are focused, meaningful, and hard-fought. The length, while considerable, feels appropriate and engaging throughout.   I\\'m lukewarm on the start player mechanism (bid 1,000 short and you could be in last--meh) and the polls (a -2 you can\\'t see coming without memorizing the poll deck is pretty shitty) but there\\'s enough in play to mitigate them that it\\'s not of huge concern.  A shame that most modern Euros have fallen so far from the tree. Is it possible that the best euro ever is a game from 1986 about the German elections? Totally. Game holds up extremely well despite it\\'s age. Moves a long at a nice clip. Takes a few rounds before you see how all of the systems interact. It\\'s really, really good. There\\'s so much going on here, and it\\'s so dynamic. All of the parts work together in multiple ways, and you need money for everything, but it can be hard to come by. You can\\'t win elections by yourself, and so you need the other players to help you, and when the time is right, you have to backstab them in order to take the victory. At the end, a whole lot changes, as a couple of parts of the national agenda come into play. I think I\\'d rate it even higher, but the learning curve is steep and it\\'s hard to understand all the moving parts and the game just takes a long time to play. Still, a classic, and an excellent game. Cool concept, okay to play. Is an hour too long to my liking, and the end scoring feels like it doesn\\'t represent what the game preceding it felt like. good game only played once but like to play it again Kickstarter; can\\'t wait for my first play of this one! Yay!  It is mine!  One of my favorite brain burners, but damn, it\\'s a hard sell.  New edition.  It\\'s a great political game that suffers from some minor flaws (like polls).  But it is very engaging, and pretty thinky.  Enough hidden elements to help folks avoid AP.  High degree of player interaction, or else it might be a bit lower for me. Grail game! Shame about the paper money! Can\\'t wait to try at 5 players, Highly interactive, tough resources management game - resources being stuff like politicians, media control, and money, not the usual stone , wood, gold, ore etc ... Judging by the theme (winning votes in several federal states) you\\'d expect quite a \"dry\" game, but it\\'s not, rather thrilling. Don\\'t remember the original game in details, but I\\'d think this enhanced version is just what it needed to be a really great game.  You need some work to get into it, but good rules and a very helpful PA are a great support. Awesome game. Forces you to watch your expenses, keep an eye on your opponents\\' party platforms. Bidding on public survey is a little odd but doesn\\'t ruin anything. Another advantage is that coalition is determined by rules. Thematic game - I enjoyed it /*#U2*//*stay*/ Still not sure about this game after my first play. It was quite fun but there was one issue: \\'more mechanisms for your buck than any other game\\' I paraphrase one of the other players, but yes this game actually has multiple variants of mechanisms all squeezed in, no less than three different types of auction, majority and largest control. Wow...  Good game though not played for a while. A long game, but worth it. Shame about the confusing artwork, in the Valley Games edition, though.  This game is surprisingly awesome.  It is big and impressive to look at.  The play is simpler than it seems at first blush but is still quite intricate and lengthy.  There is so much going on simultaneously that it really creates a challenge.  I am also impressed with how well the theme and mechanics integrate.  That is a very impressive game.  My only concern is that it is hard to get games in considering its relatively great complexity and long play time which can be over four hour in the best of circumstances and easily more than six. Played by lo (+) Refreshing theme (+) Interesting and original gaming mechanics, very interesting way of planning ahead. Balance between strategic and tactical play. (+) Some fierce bidding rounds and some very interesting negotiation aspects (+) Structured flow of play  (-) Bad Artwork (3rd edition), some symbols are unclear -> that\\'s why I [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/1979733/die-macher?size=large]redesigned the cards[/url] (-) Some luck dependance with card draws, however the game rewards clever play and doing good risk-assessment during planning should ensure good results on the long run (-) Quite lengthy game, I don\\'t mind this so much as it is a truly satifying experience in which time flies by, but it\\'s not always easy to find people who are willing to commit so much time and thought into such a title, a shame really. (-) Potential for a run-away leader problem: winning elections brings income and party membership. This can be used to make life miserable to those who lag behind.  Approx gametime: 50 - 55 min / player 游戏性9 题材8 体验6 美工6 Played twice (I\\'ve been Grune). I think it is a good game. It\\'s too long for what it is.  I won\\'t suggest it myself, but I won\\'t turn it down if it\\'s offered.  It\\'s really just a convention-only game, because of how hard it is to round up people for something this massive.  But it\\'s a good one. Well worth the multiple-hour play time.  So many ways to influence the outcome and so many choices about where to invest your energy make for excruciating decisions.  Our last game went down to the last vote - and ended in a tie! Loads to think about in every turn.  It\\'s a bit abstract, but if you don\\'t mind that it\\'s worthwhile.  I like that there is very little randomness.  The cards can be hard to tell apart from a distance (especially nuclear and factory) which has hurt me on more than one occasion.  Very solid, but dense.  Not a game for every games day, but outstanding every couple months. Solid game, well figured out. Just one play, rating may go up or down. New in shrink. Granddaddy of Eurogames. It\\'s impressive in scope, depth, level of engagement and thought. Alas, it also takes about 5 hrs for a full game. (Actually closer to 7 in my group) Everyone should try it once! REALLY enjoyed this; not as difficult to play as rating would suggest. This is a very interesting game with a ton of potential.  A lot of how I feel about this game really depends on how long the game takes.  At 3 hours, this is an epic game.  At 5 hours, this is a good game, but nothing I want to play often.  At 6+ hours, this is a painful experience that is hopefully confined to the learning game. How-to-simulate-a-democracy? Well done. Am I the only one concerned about the heavy influence of the random Opinion Poll cards? Finally played this one. Quite long, but we were having fun, so I didn\\'t notice the time go. The fun had more to do with the gamers I played with though. This is a tough one. I can see why many love it: tough decisions, managing your money, where to deploy votes, media, etc. But much of the game is rather \"dry,\" to quote a fellow player. I wasted lots of money on opinion cards that didn\\'t help at all. Perhaps there\\'s a little too much to have to juggle at the same time.  Play the german election in 5 hours.  There are ambiguities in the rules that need to be sorted and agreed before play starts.  There is also significant luck in the Public Opinions but otherwise it is fun to play.  (a game session http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/397965) Interesting first play.  I started off strong, then made a few critical mistakes and got completely shut out of the last two elections (102 votes total!), relegating me to next-to-last place.  Definitely want to play again, but not sure whether the rating is likely to up or down -- chaos is not usually something I appreciate in games, and Die Macher has it in spades. Zambo taught me this at Origins 05.  This is a tough game to rate.  I enjoyed watching the interplay between the issues and the elections.  I was also left feeling that this game could have been done in less time.  I have no idea what I would take out or simplify, though.  The shadow cabinet adds alot of control to the game, that might otherwise be dominated by the luck of the issue draw.  I loved trying to manipulate the contribution cards to try to get the most out of them.  Each election felt like a combination of issues and political manipulation.  This game is far from abstract, but still, it feels like there is more game than there needs to be.  If I am going to spend this long playing a game, I want to feel like I\\'m doing more than manipulating a system.  I hope I get a chance to try it again.  Our game ran longer than it should have, and my opinion might change considerably when I\\'m not floundering through the first few turns. Not likely to hit the table too often but if you can find 4 or 5 players who want a fulfilling and epic euro-game experience this it the one to get. A difficult game to rate. There\\'s nothing particularly clever about the game. Its a fairly simple area-majority game with about 15 phases each round. However, all the different phases do seem to gel together very well to make for an engaging game.  Some thoughts: I would\\'ve liked money to have been tighter. It seems way to easy to get money, especially in the later stages and I never felt like I had to save up for anything. I\\'m a little iffy about the dice-rolling, however I can accept that it simulates the fickle public quite well. Valley games have terrible artwork for the cards which really do affect playability. Different issues with similar graphics? What were they thinking? An interesting game, but the luck of the draw can seriously hamper your options.  Even though I seem to be able to draw nothing but policy cards I already had, I still liked the experience. I can see how this is a great game and whilst I enjoyed it whilst I was playing it, I am not a man who can play one game over 3.5 hours, particularly when it really requires 5 players to shine. Played twice, initial impressions good, looking forward to play again. This is a very interesting and engaging game in which one tries to build up influence through a series of elections.  It is also quite long, complicated rules-wise and more than a bit too fiddly for its own good.  It also seems to have a large amount of chaos for such a long, calculation-heavy game.  Ultimately, however, the game\\'s charm outweighs its flaws for me. nice mechanics but very long game Played once (with 4 players). Definitely an interesting game, with lots of decisions (both on a strategic and a tactic level) and quite a lot of player interaction. Game length is not as much of a problem as I feared (we played a short game in barely more than 2 hours, which would make a full game require about 3 hours at most), but the randomness in the polls might be more of a problem. Still, this is a game I am looking forward to playing again. I\\'m not too fond of the poll implementation and a few of the fiddly details.  Otherwise it is quite good, but would prefer to play shorter area majority games. A good game that is involved and interesting. I\\'ve only played one full game, but it almost felt like too it was a bit too long. On the flip side, I could see where a 5 round game might not feel right.   Really nothing like it. This game was very involving, but a real commitment in terms of time and brain cells. Clever game that comes with one of the worst rules booklet (translation?). Finally got to play this monster and was generally pleased. The one thing that disappointed was the final turn (7). For a game in which I invested 4 1/2 hours, the final turn ended up being discouragingly random and heavily-weighted. Turn sevel allows no regular play that will affect it, and the flip of the last card can make or break a campaign. Further, the fact that there are no coalitions and that the winner essentially gets to replace TWO of the national policies makes for a huge swing in final victory points.  After a hard-fought game it really all just comes down to who wins the final election. I was not pleased by this. Sure, it may be thematically accurate that the entire election comes down to the turn of one unknown policy, but I don\\'t have to spend 4 1/2 hours to simulate something so random. *** I\\'m giving this a tentative 7.5 (the first decimal rating to date) pending another play. Too much going on here.  Too long.  Just not as much fun.  But, a good game nonetheless. A very tentative rating based on one play.  I think I\\'d like this the more I get to know it.  It has to be said that it\\'s pretty dry and involved, but I felt early on that I had a bit of an idea what I was doing.  For a deep game, there is still quite a lot of luck in it, but I think you can mitigate against most of it if you\\'re careful. Very good, best with 5.  4 is playable.   Some graphical issues with the VG edition, namely nukes and warehouses look the same.    A touch long for many situations. I played it once long ago in Virginia and recall that it was a great game. Best 4 hour game about the german political system ever It is fiddly.  It is long.  It is cluttered with odd mechanisms.  Yet, despite these shortcomings, a Die Macher game starts like a roller coaster ride (slowly building up speed) and then midway through the thrill starts to build up leading to a great payoff.  I was frustrated by my lack of matches in the initial board setup. It makes it very hard to get an engine going if you aren\\'t in a position to compete at all in the first 3 elections. Other than that sort of randomness, though, I had a lot of fun. Each time I play I have to learn the game again. Not that it is very complicated mechanic wise, but it is a game that should be played at least a few times in a row to get the hand of where to spend, what to bid and which elections to take part in. You need to constantly keep track of your party platforms as they effect so many parts of the game, including elections which are the key to getting points (since they give you points during the election and give you a chance at getting points later). There is a lot of thought as actions will effect many parts of the game. The theme fits well also, which adds to the game play. BestWith:5>4 [Planning, Resource Management, Negotiation, Bidding, Political] Rating is after two plays.  Enjoy Die Macher.  While it\\'s a very long game, I would gladly play again as you are always involved in the game.  Wish more games kept you as involved as this one does. Lots of different mechanism interwoven together into a very thematical strategy game. In the end it becomes a bit repetitive and uncontrollable though. Talk about sensory overload. Seeing this board set up and ready to play can be a little intimidating. So many cards, so many wooden cubes, and yet after a round or two everything makes sense. German politics: an interesting way to spend an afternoon. An excellent game, but one that can very rarely get played due to its length.  However, for all its length, there is no downtime in the game and the theme is so enthralling that the time absolutely flies by. No es tan complicado como dicen pero si que hay que tener en cuenta multitud de factores. Y eso es lo mejor del juego, que aÃºn haciendo muchas cosas durante el juego funcione tan bien. Hans im Gluck version Four playings, one with 5 players and three with 4.  This is a pretty tight little game, 4 or 5 hours straight where you are involved (and thinking) just about every second.  I like it but the theme and dryness keep me from really desiring to play it.  Its not luck free, but the luck factors don\\'t appear to unbalance the game.  I have noted that others\\' comments on how powerful the last round is appear to be true (in at least three of our games, the player who won the 7th election won the game.  It is worth noting, however, that in those games that player ALSO had the highest Party membership, but the ability to shape the national issues also appears to be very important).   This game would be a solid 9 or a 10 if it didn\\'t take 6 hours to play a full game.  I love the mechanics, and would love to play it again, but I doubt I will get too many opportunities. Well after playing my first game, i have to say im kinda disappointed...while it think is great on the whole scale and all the thought but it was a little overwhelming. My group does not particularly care for it either as it is hard to focus on strategies with all the little rules. will probably grow on me more and more when i start to grasp it. 1.5 kg Keep it or trade it!?!? A beutiful simulation of \"proportional electoral system\" politics. It\\'s not a game for every group or for every night, but it\\'s an awesome experience when you find the time to play! It\\'s a shame that it\\'s heavyweight nature relegates it on the shelf. I\\'ve wanted this game ever since I discovered it.  When Valley Games did the reprint I ordered one up right away.  The components are sub-par in the edition, but the game is awesome.  I\\'ve never actually played a full 7 province game (we\\'ve only done the short 5 province variant) since there has always been a new player involved.  I\\'d love yo get this one on the table more. Awesome game.  I enjoy playing, the only caveat being the length, so I can\\'t always agree to play it, but I\\'d like to play more often. This is an awesome game. I just don\\'t like the dice rolls and you can get lucky on card draws.  I have now played three times and have been lost for most of the game on all three games. It\\'s a great game but I don\\'t think I have the mental facilities to play it. This is NOT as overwhelming as people would have you think.  Watch Scott Nicholson\\'s video and manipulate the bits and you will have it figured out.  You may suck at it, but that isn\\'t the same as not knowing how to play it. Had on backorder at Borders for so long I gave up.  Now it\\'s arrived need to find people to play it! A solid game that I don\\'t get to play as often as I want to.  I\\'ve only played the original edition and not the newer one, so I really can\\'t comment on the differences, though some of the changes, as described to me, sound like steps in the wrong direction... 2010-06-05 (rating 7.5):  I like the game. But it wasn\\'t as heavy as I expected (sadly). Some luck factor, not large but still significant (especially when it comes to polls). But more depends on interactions between players.  This is somewhat strange as the game is way to long for a light, heavy interaction, party game. And yet I didn\\'t feel I had enough influence on the game progress to call it a Diplomacy-kind of game.  But I played it only once and we didn\\'t do much negotiations (sadly). 2006 3 - 5 player game. I really like this game but it always seems like you are taking actions without a main goal. Hard to guage what effect your actions will have. Very good game.   Long but always involved and lots to think about...  Also has game politics done well. No \\'lets all gang up on the winner\\' but more a case of \\'I\\'ll help you if you help me...\\'  ---  TRADED: Would never get played - cool game tho\\' Square tomatoes!  Mainly dinged for play time that makes it hard to pull out.  gixmo Heavyweight game. Played it a couple of time and really enjoyed it. Would love to play it again. Great game.  It does play as long as noted if not longer.  Which is why the 7.5 would be atleast 8.5 if not higher if shorter in span.  Also its alot of work but satisfying.  Which all put togehter is why I only want to play about once a year. Played this 4 times for a few weeks in a row.  The end game scoring always caught me by surprise.  I wasn\\'t a fan of the swingy-ness of the opinion polls.  Fascinating game though. The Cadillac of Euros. Classic. Love it. I really love it. Euro with a fitting theme and interaction as well as involvement to stay fun all those hours! 2E Brent Clark donated his copy to me on Dec 7/18.  I had played it once at ToonCon in 2018.  I had tried it with Brent once when he had first bought his copy, but we only got through 1 turn and nobody understood the game at all. 規則: *先決定進行長遊戲或短遊戲，短遊戲時移除不使用的政客卡，一個票箱標記，跟每人一個媒體標記 *先組好中央版還有其他版塊，將州卡根據有無*號分類洗勻，兩疊各抽兩張在洗勻後放置在圖版四個對應位置，票箱標記放在分數最低的那一區，七種公共議題卡+-各一張開著放在對應區，剩下的洗勻在每個版塊邊緣四格放四張蓋著，從有票箱的那區開是順時鐘開4/3/2/1張(開牌時如果開到一樣的或是一樣議題但是相反的則棄掉抽牌補)，10張民調卡洗勻放置民調版，政黨議題卡洗勻放至對應位置然後根據人數開對應張數，雙重標記放雙重版 *每人拿一個顏色配件跟一組五張的政客卡跟三張捐獻卡蓋著，在四個圖版計票區放置記錄配件0分面朝上在0位置，另外一個放在政黨基礎軌10位置，然後在四個放在四個區的政黨趨勢格0位置，每人在拿30圓，每人在抽7張政黨議題卡，輪抽每次選一張蓋著，直到最後拿到左邊來的三張後，從七張選五張打出(要不同，如果沒辦法則在抽牌補)，政黨順位標記隨機洗勻在雙重版疊起，每人拿一張計分紙，選擇一區，在該區五格填上你想調整的省份狀態(同樣符號不能填同樣省份)，全部填完在一起打開，並根據你設定的狀態調整(放置方塊，媒體圓柱，提升票數，提升趨勢) *遊戲進行四輪，每輪有九個階段如下 1.競標起始  使用紀錄紙左下寫下標金，金額最高的支付金額並將順位疊自己政黨移到最上面(平手在輪流喊價競標，從靠近上輪起始右手的先) 2.改變政黨議題  起始開始順時鐘輪流，每個玩家可以選擇抽一張蓋著的跟一張開著的或是棄掉全部再補滿在抽一張開的，拿完新卡後可用手牌跟面前交換最多兩張，然後棄到剩一張手牌，下一個玩家抽牌前要補開完空格(全部抽完棄牌洗勻在抽) 3. 起始開始順時鐘，輪流可花5元放置一個媒體圓柱到一個區的外圍空格，輪到時可跳過，全部人跳過才結束 4.動員黨工 起始開始順時鐘輪一次，每個區域決定要買幾個黨工支付對應金額(不同區分開結算)放在該區你政黨旁的黨工格，上限每區8 5.使用卡牌 起始開始順時鐘一輪，每次輪到時可在每區最多蓋著放一張 6.結算卡牌 從有票箱標記的開始順時鐘，開所有牌，並照放置順序結算，要結算的玩家要支付對金額(沒付就移除)，結算完後牌移除，結算最上方行動後下方行動二選一 *驚嘆號的相關行動一區只能做一次，有人做過就不能再做 >放置或移除*2標記在一張開的公共議題卡，每一區最多一個 >移動自己政黨趨勢標記向上一格或是其他退一格 >投票移動對應格數 >改變自己政黨議題同2 >支付一個玩家5元來移除他的媒體圓柱一個並放置一個自己的取代(沒得取代就不放) >拿最上方的民調卡，選擇公開或不公開同8 7.媒體影響 有票箱標記的開始順時鐘，每個區如果有玩家媒體圓柱單獨最多，可以移除該區一張公共議題牌，並從開的區域選一張補(不能用一樣議題的補)，開的區域不補(有*2標記得不能移除) 8.競標民調 有票箱標記的開始順時鐘，每一區都結算一次，該區票數最多的為主持人(平手靠近起始的)，從他左手開始輪流喊價一輪，標到的拿走卡，並選擇不公開，該政黨基礎+3點，或是公開(該政黨趨勢是上升才能選)根據該卡移動政檔趨勢(控制該區媒體的不會因為民調下降) *如果喊價時超過自己有的錢，要支付所有錢並且降低政黨基礎10點，該玩家此階段不能行動，競標重來 9.選舉結算 有幾個階段如下 a. 從有票箱的右邊區反序結算各區，每區從起始開始順時鐘輪流，黨工方塊可以換成選票 >沒票箱的 至少要支付四個方塊，票數等於(方塊+政黨趨勢)x對應的主題(政黨議題跟公共議題相同的加1，相反的-1，*2標記得算兩點，最後總合至少1) >有票箱的 所有玩家都要轉，至少一顆就可以轉成票，方塊跟政黨總和最小是1 b.計分 根據你的票數還有該區的州卡拿對應分數，然後再結算如下 >單一政黨超過50票 該政黨拿12分，所有玩家紀錄結果在計分紙，如果他還有至少一個媒體在該區，移動一個到媒體政黨基礎版放在對應區(第一個在10) >兩個以上政黨超過50票 各拿10分，但是最多票的是為此區勝者(平手都算)，勝者有媒體標記結算同上 >最多票的不到50票 最多票的找同盟(平手起始先找，要優先找議題相近的)，只能找一個且總和票數要超過50，找到後兩個政黨一起7分，媒體標記同上，如果不能同盟則最多票的五分 *控制媒體的如果沒有移動過媒體標記可以同上移動 c.賺錢(最後一輪跳過) 起始開始順時鐘，該去除勝者額外分數外拿幾分就拿多少錢，跟據政黨基礎每一點拿一元，玩家可在選擇是否使用捐獻卡，可拿10/20/30元然後基礎降1/2/3點或是不拿錢但是基礎上升1/3/5，然後使用的卡移除 d.準備下輪 舉辦完選舉的圖板移除，然後剩下的每區開一張公共議題卡(重複的一樣移除在補)，然後棄掉政黨議題卡在重開 *遊戲最後結束時，跟據媒體版上每個圓柱拿對應上面的分數，政黨基礎每點一分，剩下最多錢的第一名6分第二名3分 Kickstarter July 2018. Really entertaining economic game hidden under a political theme. There is constant tension between you and your opponents and you have to pick your battles wisely. Valley Games Ed. Could play this game much more if time and ppl were more readily available. A great design and game flow. 2021-02-13 - 7.5 - finally I played the game with id #1 on BGG. The new edition to be precise. It\\'s standing strong. It\\'s logical, thematic, gives you opportunities to get advantage now (which might be risky), or to plan for better result in the future (which might be risky too). I don\\'t like the graphic design. It\\'s clear and legible, but dated and ugly - from the new cover I expected much more. I\\'m eager to play again.  The politics in real life are tiring and more and more repulsive, but making politics in a board game - it\\'s a lot of fun! Very interesting game, but long (including the short version) with a lot of AP and stuff to manipulate with your party agenda and voters wants. The rulebook is scary but at it\\'s heart it is a procedure driven game I\\'ve only played the 5-round version which itself takes ~4 hours, required a lot of long term strategy rather than tactics Be sure at least one person knows the rules through n through This game of politics is a good game, especially for the time it was made. There\\'s some really good battles for votes and gaining majority in a city, and needing to be competitive in multiple cities. This game can be mean as you can mess with peoples popularity in areas and take control of media so you can switch out issues within the area. The game is really long and there\\'s dice rolling in this game that can really hamper your progress, and combine those two things, making this game have some issues. There\\'s allot of thins I really like in this game, but there are a few things that bring it down. I\\'d play this again, if I have time available, but I would not add this to my collection. After my first game in a long while (14/1/07) then some concern about money in the game, and thus giving it the score 7.25. However before any long term commitment to this position (as opposed to a higher score) then I want to read the rules through again, likewise the rules on coalitions.  Aside from game length issues, then my score ought to be higher I feel.   dense, complicated, and long... in a good way... weeeeeeee! Fun Factor: 6  (As my friend said \"Dry as a popcorn puff\") Components: 8 (Nice wooden bits and plenty of cards)  Theme: 7  Mechanics: 7 (Perhaps a bit fiddly...) Theme + Mechanics: 7 Replay Value: 9 Scaling/Players: N/A (No opportunity to observe.)    SURPRISE I enjoy the battle of votes, the balance of trying to plan further ahead vs the need to get money from the current election.  Would rank higher, but I feel like the game ends up being chaotic (player chaos as the issues are changed and game chaos from the poll cards) for as long as it is. Interesting simulation of the German election. Quite meaty and long. I prefer the short variant (5 rounds). I keep waffling my rating a bit on this one, between a 7 and an 8. I really like the challenge of the game, all the tough and interesting choices it confronts you with, and the fact that it feels really thematic as you try to figure out which regions your party will run well in and how you can change your party platform to please the voters. What I don\\'t like is the fact that the luck of the draw on the polls and the platform cards seems a bit too heavy given the weight and length of the game.  On the one hand, thematically, these luck elements feel right. You shouldn\\'t be able to arbitrarily change your party\\'s platform all the time, and voters are often unpredictable. But, this is a long game (5-6 hours), and one with a lot of energy and emotional investment, and yet one that can turn on a single poll card or getting good platform draws. I guess I just wish the game were just a bit shorter. At 5 hours, this is the same length as Revolution, Successors, or Civilization (with 5), and I don\\'t feel that it\\'s nearly as rewarding as those games. --- Note: We always play with a house rule that if the 80-seat region comes out in the initial 4 elections, we replace it. This region (which was added in the 1996-ish Hans-im-Gluck reprint and not the original) could, and probably should, be removed from the game. --- Edition Note: There are now 3 versions of the game, the original (and now very hard-to-find) Moskito edition, the updated Hans-im-Gluck version, and the Valley Games reprint of the Hans-im-Gluck edition. The big differences are between the Moskito and HiG versions; the latter version supports a fifth player, has fewer restrictions on the parties, and a couple other minor rule changes I don\\'t specifically recall. The Valley Games version has updated issues and slightly more internationally-friendly cards.  Probably the Hans-im-Gluck version is the best; it\\'s graphically the most professional and functional (some of the CG illustrations in the Valley Games version are cheesy), and while there is German on some of the cards, it\\'s not a big deal. The Valley Games edition is of slightly lower printing quality and some of the symbols on the issue cards are strange (although some of the complaints I\\'ve heard seem overblown). The Valley Games version does have a more sensibly-sized box, though! Die Macher is finally starting to show its age. It still plays mostly fine, but some of the design choices seem odd by todays standards. 4 hours - HA! Plan on 8 if you are playing with any inexperienced players (including yourself). It takes about an hour or more to just explain/understand the rules. ... though I havn\\'t played it for far to long.  too long for the payoff, a once a year game The longest German game in my collection, and one of the best.  It takes a while, but it is always engaging.  I can\\'t play too often, though--I find this one quite draining to play. Entertaining but initially complex. If I had this game I\\'d have trouble finding someone else to play it. A bit ponderous, but it IS amazing how everything fits together. Not quite as good as I expected. Would be better shorter. first Edition by Moskito my favorite game when I was a student, can\\'t spend much time to this game now A real brain-burner. Just looking at it set up on the table is enough to give some folks a headache. Nevertheless a great game and shows the true Hypocrisy of policians. Watch how the party platforms tend to converge toward the end of the game. not as complicated as they make you believe This game always seems to go exactly 4 hours long, no matter how many players we have. The mechanics of the game are great, but the theme could use some improvement...instead of German politics, maybe change it to candy making!  Great game, but probably too long for me. Played once with 5 players. Pretty heavy game. Took one hour to explain the rules, and then 4 more to play. Seemed a little dry, maybe, but on the other hand I feel a strange urge to play it again...  There\\'s just too much going on in this game for my taste. I guess it could be an awesome game after you\\'ve tried it a couple of times but not sure I\\'ll give it that much time? Karl-Heinz Schmiel (1.5 plays) Initial reaction:Long, Upkeepedy, and Fun. Treece Keenes is the MAN!!!!  Alas, I\\'ll probably never get to play it again. After one play: Great game, but way too long for what it has to offer. Also, the level of luck is too high for a game this serious. I\\'m afraid that I have too many great games that last half as long, so I\\'m not really sure how often this will hit the table. If you have even *heard* about this game you are a real game geek. Possibly the most dull theme ever devised, but it works oh so well. It\\'s such a shame it is so hard to organise games, but enjoyable and tense without fail when we do play. My favourite game to show non-gamers to scare them! Even if you are scared of the theme and supposed complexity, give it a chance - I promise you won\\'t be disappointed. For a 4 hour game, the rules are very easy to teach, since the game occurs in phases (a la Power Grid) and turns. I like this, but cannot convince my regular gaming friends to agree. I had an excellent play of it and the next time would be smoother.  It seemed really long for what it was, esp. given the variability of the poll cards and that if the larger provinces come out first, catching up seemed hard. Played only once. I try to avoid new playings. I have to say it... TOO MUCH tense and TOO MUCH deep. The board is a little complicated at first glance but all makes sense eventually. The game plays well, can be a little long but not overly so. A good game but complex. It\\'s well-balanced but because of its complexity, I won\\'t play it everynight. Still it is a good game.  Can\\'t rate higher because each play requires 30+ minutes to relearn the rules.   Fawktastic game, though! My current rating for the game is more due to my desire to play again, and is highly volitile. I like how much thought has to be put into actions. I have also found, however, that having a high-value election in the first round can skew money for the whole game. Lots of concentration needed. HiG 2nd edition.  It\\'s a good game, but the randomness of the polls makes it hard to rate this too highly. For the length of game, it\\'s a little too random to be at the top of my game selection. A great game, with the right group.  The components are in German, but are OK if you have player aids and rules in English.  A great combination of a variety of mechanics, with good scope for multiple strategies for victory.  A long game - expect the first game to take 5+ hours. *Finally* played this crazy game.  I thought I\\'d like it, and...I did.  But no one else did, so it would sit untouched for a decade.  What a beautiful synthesis of disparate mechanisms.  But a bit too much time to invest in such a strange theme, I guess.  And the luck element is disturbingly high for a game this long and involved. [I\\'ve rated this using the BGG recomended ratings.]  This is NOT a political game in the sense that simulates a political process. It is an abstract pure and simple which is primarily based on an extremely involved area majority mechanic. That mechanic operates on two different but interacting levels: ideally, you want to have the most votes in an area (with the amount of your votes being a function of how many SMALL cubes you have in that area, with there being 7 areas in total) in which you also have the most BIG cubes. The involved nature of the area control mechanic relates primarily as to how the number of SMALL cubes that give rise to votes is calculated, and how it can be changed. There is also an auction aspect to the game, but the game is not really an auction game. Finally, there is actually a set collection aspect to the game which is important to how the SMALL cubes are converted to votes: each player has a set of cards on display, and each area does to, a player can covert there SMALL cubes to an increasing number of votes if the player\\'s cards increasingly match the area\\'s cards. In summary, the game is not really about politics; it\\'s an abstract.  One of the best heavy euros. 4+h of tight cube pushing and surprisingly this is thematically sound, you find that game is almost simulator like in outcome of political vote harvesting. This is unarguably a superb game.  It has tons of things going on and there are dozens of different avenues to success.  It\\'s strong both in strategy and in tactics.  Where it fails for me is in the length.  Four hours for a game is just too long for me to want to play it very often.  Many will argue that those four hours are packed solid with gaming goodness and they\\'d be right but still, it\\'s just too long for my tastes.  I\\'d still happily play it again if enough people asked me to but I just don\\'t think I\\'d go out of my way to do it and I don\\'t think the opportunity is likely to come up all that often. Played twice now. A game you come away from more impressed (and fatigued) than pleased. The union of so many mechanics is genius, as is the physical presentation of so much information. Appealing fidelity to the theme. However, falls short of being a favourite owing to the length combined with luck element of the draw. I could see my rating for Die Macher increase if I played it repeatedly with a committed group. I need to be in a special mood for this one.  If I have the kind of time on my hands that this game requires, I\\'d usually prefer a war game of some kind. Pros: A highly unique game Cons: Involves a LOT of calculations and ultimately does not seem to serve its subject well. provisional rating after a single play (and much post-game discussion). This is complex, and all the compelxity adds to the tension. We\\'ll be playing again soon and often. First play was 5.5 hours, we\\'re certain it\\'ll go much faster next time. What to say about this one.  There are many little interlinking systems in this game that make up a big uber game.  I played this once, and I can say that luck or player induced randomness made this one a bit hard to swallow.  We played for 3 1/2 hours, which was shorter than I anticipated, but it was hard to take since I had mis-spent my political clout in the beginning and never really recovered.  I\\'d try again, but it\\'s definitely not something I\\'d play all the time Its good.  Take whole bunch of great mechanisms and add a scoresheet that balances them all in the right way and you pretty much have Die Macher.  Area Majority, Blind Auction, Open Auction, Set Collection, Alliances, Decisions, Strategy with Tactics and random elements that don\\'t really decide who wins, but do change the game.  Definately worth playing even at its intimidating ruleset and playing time.  The time really does fly by when engaged in this classic. Mail Order from Valley Games 2007 first edition Played once, screwed myself over on turn one and wasn\\'t able to recover. Want to try again to see how it goes without such an unrecoverable error. Liked the play of the game though. Got to look ahead. First game played 11/25/06. Was FDP (yellow). Did Ok on the Mandate, screwed up the National Media and did lousy on the the Membership. Did best on Matching Votes with highest score and bonus. But one cannot screw up two whole scoring categories and expect to do well. I came in last. I was all over the map, but I learned what things do and what they don\\'t do. Next time I\\'ll aim forMandate: 200 pointsNational Media: 75Membership: 75Matching Votes: 75For a total of 425 points. That would probably be enough to win. The only reason I\\'ve scored this as 7 is due to the length of it... over 5 hours the first time we played!  In terms of my enjoyment of the game it would be a 9 (even though I came last).  Despite the length there was pretty much no down-time and I was engaged throughout.  If you don\\'t mind the political theme, this is a truly excellent game and well worth setting aside some time to playing. Never getting THOSE ten hours of my life back. valley games edition. I wish I had the HiG one. Production quality pretty low One play under my belt. It was pretty fun, but it\\'s soooo long. Solid game.  This rating has slipped from 8.5 after our last play.  I guess I\\'m just wishing that, for a game where the last ten minutes are so \"swingy\" this was just a little bit shorter.  The mechanics are obviously very good, but I just feel like the balance is a bit off, that the game is a bit too back-loaded, with the end MUCH more important than the other parts.  It\\'s pretty important not to appear to be doing too well heading into the last few elections, since people can absolutely savage a leader in the national issues, erasing hours of lead-building.  None of this would faze me at all in a two hour game.  Still, it\\'s clearly the best election game I\\'ve ever played.  I wish like hell that there was a game of this caliber that focused somehow on American politics.  Ah well.  I think my big criticism of this game is that there isn\\'t actually enough negotiation. While there is a cooperative element, these decisions, at least in my limited experience, are not as opaque as one would like.  Wonderful game if you\\'re willing to spend the time playing it.  The randomness of the polls can cause quite a lot of frustration and, although thematic, take away more than they add. A classic \"7\". I like it well enough to play it if someone\\'s hot to get it going, but not well enough to suggest it myself.  I like that elections start long and take progressively less time, as opposed to most long games where turns get longer and longer as the night goes on. Really wanting to get this out to learn.(Vassal) (Trade Interest: high) after all these years of not having played this, i finally have, and it does live up to its reputation.  it is definitely the father of modern boardgames.  it has all the tough and varied decision trees, tight player v player situations, symbols over theme, of a modern Euro.  That it is cast as a German election, gives it a mystery, at least to us non-German players.  the mechanics are varied and very good.  thumbs up to this classic. We play this game once every year. Played one time. Needs more plays before I give it a \"real\" rating but it will certainly not be a 10 for me. There are some things I have issues with but would play again to make sure we have the rules (and it is a fiddly monster) correct.   The Opinion polls seemed overpowered. The are rather random, but thats not the problem, it seemed that the election swung on them (either they helped the guy who won the bid and he took it or they didnt help and he lost.) I will chalk this up to us not knowing what we were doing and not getting votes in an election early enough.   also the national opinion cards changed very quickly at the end of the game swinging the points for players wildly. Again if i knew this was that easy to do then it might not have been a big deal, but It was unexpected and really messed up the scoring.   I can see why a lot of folks here rate this game so high. Part of it is due to its (until 2006) rarity. It will be interesting to see if the VG version and the fact that more people will have access to the game changes its score. Also BBG\\'er seem to like games with large amount of options and this one certainly has that. The question is what percentage of them do anything.   New - still in shrinkwarp.  Someone else in my game group has this...so mine can be traded! :) Captures some elements of politics by forcing the players to change their party\\'s policies or try to change the mind of the electorate. The last of the BGG Top 10 for me to play...and it\\'s pretty much awesome.  Took a LOOONG time, but never felt it as I was always involved with something.  Getting the playtime down to 3-4 hours will make this an easy 10. Highly cool, but a bit on the heavy side, which makes most players take too long to decide on even the smallest of actions and drags the game a bit. The heaviest euro game I know off. (11 maa 07 after 1 play)          (05-28-07) - Just wanted to update that since that initial purchase I\\'ve played another time but again not real game.  Seems like a game that I will get to play once a year or so but I think it is worth it.  Just have to have the 2 or 3 other players to get into the theme and scheme. :)  (04-01-07) - Played for the first time with the lady.  Just ran through the flow of the game to get an idea of what it is like.  So far I really like it.. not enough to give it a rating yet though. Fun, but a bit complex for my taste.   Not a bad game, but it requires a great deal of micromanagement - the kind of micromanagement that makes you wonder what exactly you were doing when it was all over. Perhaps with more plays it\\'s secrets will be revealed. The big key seems to be when to spend your money, encourage the others to spend loads of theirs and make sure you have a big handfull of cash for the last three auctions - you want to be able to prevent anyone from getting two out of those final three auctions.  I\\'m still not exactly sure how I won the one game I played.   http://spotlightongames.com/list/nights/m.html Unplayed Rather need to play this more than once; very hard to get head around due to many things happening at once. (Based on 1 game only)  Fascinating. A great theme & interesting mechanics (though how well they are married to each other in this game remains to be seen with further play). I don\\'t really think of this as a Euro though, it owes too much to the non-wargames of the early Avalon Hill years. In all cases though, I\\'m looking forward to my next game.  As it is, I played the 1 game with far too much sentimentality for my favourite German states. Maybe in further games I will be more ruthless, hehehe. A little long, other than that, absolutely brilliant.  Update:  Raised rating to 9.  This game gets better every time I play it.  There are so many different strategies, that right now, I cannot see how it will ever get boring.  I must admit though, that I look forward to playing a game with all experienced players.  I have never played without a least one new player, and I would like see how long it takes to play with all veterans.  Update:  Raised rating to a 10.  Played with four experienced players.  Total time 3 hr. 5 min. or about 45 min per player (and we took our time).    This game is an absolutely wonderful blend of long term strategic thinking mixed with quick tactical ploys to take advantage of unplanned situations (or unexpected setbacks).  With opinion polls, bribes and political backstabbing, the theme merges with the mechanics quite well.  Like a real election, you\\'re never quite sure who is going to win until the last vote is counted. Engaging, but I\\'m not sure if it\\'s entertaining. My biggest complaint is that there\\'s too much money floating around. The only thing to soak up the extra cash are the opinion polls - the single most random element in the game. So polls, which could be useless, were selling for 10s of thousands of dollars, far more than the cost of either meeting markers or media markers. So the economey felt off to me - the latter have fixed low prices but seem more valuable than the opinion polls, which always go for exorbitant prices simply because they are auctioned off and there isn\\'t anything else to spend the money on. Update: I think I\\'m done with this. It was a landmark game to be sure, with many stages within a round, and looking forward up to 3 rounds ahead. But every round seems too samey. It could be three rounds or thirty. And the randomness from the dice and cards is a bit too much. At least for a game this long. The \"let\\'s play fast\" aspirations are not enough.  ---  If you take the time to really understand the rules, it really flows quite nicely and isn\\'t that complicated. It\\'s just so hard to find the time to play. Update: I played twice in the last week. I will probably never do that again in my life. But boy was it great. The first game was a teaching game where I taught it to three new players and came in dead last (what???). Then a few days later the same group played again (shaving a full hour+ off the play time), and I redeamed myself, winning 348 to 346 (and down from there). Incredible game. SO many ways to influence the game system. So many ways to critically foul things up. :-) Excellent game, but a little intimidating for my group I have played this once (3rd edition). Good game. It is a bit complicated, but almost all the rules make a lot of sense thematically (it is about the German elections), so they are not to difficult to memorize. The fantastic player aid also helped a lot. Unfortunately the game took about six hours, which is too long for my taste. Finally got to play Die Macher! Guys from the Greater Boston Grogs guild came over and we finished in 4 hours. Very nice game, but I wouldn\\'t rate it quite as high as the rankings have it. Definitely a bunch of difficult decisions packed into a great game design.  Managing your campaign is no easy task, and the multitude of choices lead to a fairly meaty game.    The one problem some people might have is that there is a lot of luck involved, and some of the luck can be pretty brutal if it doesn\\'t go your way.  It\\'s a bit of a stark contrast to the otherwise somewhat heavy feel to the game, but I happen to find the luck more fun than frustrating (although it can certainly be frustrating to have plans wiped out by the flip of a card).  However, it\\'s not the monster I was expecting, as I\\'ve had 5 newbies get through a full game in 3.5 hours.  Definitely playable on a normal game night.    This takes a lot of time to play and the rules are very long and a bit fiddly. However it was enjoyable and I want to play it again. Bought on reputation back in the days when it was camped in the BGG top 10; I think it\\'s fairly average. Very hard to get to find a group for a five-hour game about German politics. The few plays I\\'ve had sugest that it\\'s a bit fiddly by today\\'s standards. I really like the mechanics and I see that it\\'s a good game, but we won\\'t probably play it ever again. The theme is a bit too obscure, and the game generally dry. I would play it gladly if someone asked me too, but I\\'m generally the one asking to play games and I won\\'t be asking for this one in priority. This could be rated higher, but I need more plays A little long for my tastes, but a great game if you have the time for it. I played it once, but the rules are so daunting and the game is so long that I never felt the urge to bring it to the table again. Very good strategy game with German elections as theme. Although there are some random elements like blind bidding for the opinion poll cards and the dice for party membership, planning and well thought out decisions will mostly be rewarded. The main goal is to get seats/mandates and win elections. Everything you do will influence this in one or another way: modifying your party program to align with the regional opinion (but don\\'t loose track of the national opinion which is important at the end of the game), playing shadow cabinet cards, buying media markers to influence the regional opinion, bidding for opinion polls with the hope of the trend for your own or another party, forming coalitions, organising party meetings, ... All these elements blend together very nicely in a complex, rather long but engaging game. Take in account that the 6th and 7nd election rounds might be very crucial, as the public opinions on the National Board will be hugely influenced by these two elections. ***** Owned, but sold again: 1997 edition. Had fun with this one.  Must be played with the right group as the game is rather dry.  I would enjoy playing this again. Very cool game, with lots of neat stuff going on. Valley Games version icons and cards leave a bit to be desired, though. This is a very good, but very heavy and complex, euro.  It has a lot of interaction and almost no downtime.  I appreciated the design, and I do understand how it is for certain gamers it is an ultimate gaming experience.  Also, despite the long rules, and multiple interlocking systems, once you learn the whole thing it works together pretty well and makes a lot of sense.    It is a truly great game, but one where its \"positives\" don\\'t really outweigh the problems.  At the end of the day, if I am going to play a 3+ hour game that requires 3-4 dedicated players who know a complex set of rules, there are a LOT of other things I would rather play than Die Macher.  The graphical design on the cards in the Valley Games edition is also pretty poor.  Several of the icons are nearly identical, to the point where you have to be careful not to misplan a turn based on not paying close enough attention to the icons.    That being said, the combination of bidding, blind card play, and the way the issue cards and other mechanics all interact together to produce one coherent game is pretty amazing, especially considering how many moving parts are working.   Trade interest: low Played (actually partly played) this last weekend - no understanding whatsoever of what was going on made this game a disaster. I live in hope. Our group isn\\'t up for 4 hour games though. Only played once so far. MIND BURNER. A pretty good game that I\\'ll rarely play due to the length. Four newbies played in less than 4 hours, so it\\'s not that bad, but just difficult to get scheduled.  Way to complex and complicated for what you end up playing. This one was a tough slog during the first game. You have to be pretty farsighted to play well. However, in subsequent plays with some experience, the game gets easier. Solid. There is too much luck in this game for my taste and I would prefer to try to replace this to some degree...that said, I cannot argue with the fact that this is a wonderful game of grand design that is fun to play. ATL - Love the concept of this game, but impossible to get to the table. Epic game of... ahem.... German electoral strategy.  Surprisingly fun for all that though the rules are complex and it\\'s all too easy to get left behind by naive play during your first game. Would probably rate it higher, but I was only introduced to it quickly. It\\'s gone down in my ratings for the complicated long German game category, but it\\'s still a classic and I\\'d miss playing it occasionally. As an election night game with players who know the rules you can appreciate the design and feel it\\'s worth devoting three hours to it. There\\'s a little too much luck in the cards, fiddly rules & after several playings the shine has worn off somewhat. However, once a year and it\\'ll remain appreciated. The good news: It\\'s two hours of fun.  The bad news: That fun is spread out over five hours.  The worst news: The bits use Comic Sans. Still in shrink wrap. An interesting game about the German Political system, well not really - but a nice theme. Longer than you first think, clocking in at 4 hours for four players. I enjoy the game, but it\\'s length and complexity (in that it is hard to teach new players) mean it doesn\\'t get played very often. It is a shame that the infamous play length of Die Macher has scared so many gamers away, as this is one of the best games that I have ever played.  Rich in theme, strategy, and depth, Die Macher never feels as long as it is.  Since the game is actually many small actions strung together, there are many meaningful decisions and, even for a first play, players quickly get into the flow of the game.  I cannot ever imagine turning down a game of Die Macher, unless I absolutely could not take the time or there weren\\'t enough players.  Everyone should try this at least once, and I believe that most people will love it as I do. The Valley Games version is the reason that I was able to play this game at all. (For that, thank you guys very much.  You provided a much desired reprint, and also helped to drive down the price on the oop versions.)  After the first night of playing (2 games), my group agreed on two things.  The game itself is amazing, and the cards in the Valley Games version are beyond annoying.  It\\'s so easy to mistake the economic, nuke, and even the war on terror cards with each other from a distance.  Why did they essentially ruin their production with symbols that use similar graphics and colors on something so critical to the gameplay?  After the first night of playing, I went to eBay and bought a 2nd edition copy, which has much better variation between the cards.  I truly wish Valley Games good luck on their new company, but their first release has some serious flaws in it.  I will still consider any future games of theirs to see how they are progressing, and it really seems like they\\'re trying hard to do a good job.  They got so much right with their 3rd edition release, it\\'s a shame that they missed on something so key to the game.  I\\'ve played a few times now.  This game is quite absorbing.  You need to decide where to apply your limited resources.  The uncertainty about the relative strengths of the final Bundeslands adds tension.  And then there\\'s those Opinion polls...I\\'m ready to play again.  [Initial Impression: 7]  I need more plays, but I\\'m not thrilled with the game so far. The cards seem to be quite a limitation in a game of this scope and with such a long playing time.   Unplayed (ok, played once a long time ago!). After playing Die Macher one time I would say that it is a very very good game for the 1980s.  That said the game is a bit dated for the 2000s.  It has a quite a range of options to the game and is mostly skill based.  The problem with Die Macher is that it has two luck dependent items (party platform cards and polling) that can greatly swing a game which otherwise is predominantly skill based.  If Die Macher wasn\\'t a 4+ hour game the luck element wouldn\\'t be a big issue because the rest of the game is so strong but when investing 4+ hours of time in a game it is discouraging to think that the luck of card draws can prevent you from winning (not prevent you from being competitive mind you but realistically the luck of the draw may prevent you from having a fair shot at winning the game.).   My free registration gift from BGG.Con 2007! Rating after one play. May go up. It\\'s a tough game to get your head around the first time, but I\\'m very glad to have taken the time (about 4.5 hours) to play. Haven\\'t played this enough to rate yet, but seems pretty good and far less complicated than some have made it out to be. I bought this after playing it. It is a very enjoyable game and I do recommend it. Great game. Too long. Pretty good game but for what it is, it\\'s just too long and fiddly.  If I\\'m going to spend four hours playing a single game I would rather it be a wargame.  Really I don\\'t believe it belongs in the top 10. Played 8/30/2008  Pulled this out at TCEP and had a full table, but not enough time to commit to playing a full seven rounds, so we agreed to play only five.  Rules took a LONG time to get through, and I had the \\'Board Games with Scott\\' video to explain everything. Now that I\\'ve played, it may be easier to explain the procedural processes and go from there.  Takes a LONG time, it\\'s fun, but the time commitment problem may prevent this from getting a lot of air time. A political game in which you\\'re campaigning for election to the German parliament, but the game manages to be much more interesting than the theme makes it sound. It\\'s very much a collection of Euro mechanisms (auction, majority) with some luck in which platform cards you draw and how easily you can match issues in the larger states, while the opinion polls are a total gamble that sharply contrasts with the deterministic nature of everything else. Among the best of the longer Euros, but there\\'s a bigger luck and multiplayer chaos factor than I really like to see in a four hour game. This is slightly fading on me now I\\'ve played a few times, but I don\\'t mind a rerun every now and again. We need play this one more. I\\'m yet to be conviced of this one\\'s greatness. I like it lot but in the game we played I really wasn\\'t sure of the rules. Would definatelyhave no hesitation in playing again. Wonderful. Just one game under my belt but this was just fabulous. Worth all the praise, and I was dead last in our 5-player game - but I know where I screwed up and I intend not repeat my mistake next time. The game lasted 4,5 hours   30 minutes of rules explanation. Amazingly, there is little to none downtime during play.  Edit: In our third game I was completely hosed by with bad opinion card draws: even though I changed my three-card hand thrice, I still didn\\'t get any matching opinions and therefore couldn\\'t change my opinion to match those on the board. And of course the winner\\'s of the elections kept pushing those opinions not available to me to the National Board which caused for me not to get more party members and points. Also the polls are problematic: ok, you can buy the poll to avoid getting hit by the results but what if you roll two zeros after not publishing the result? Then you get completely nothing!  Point being, I think there\\'s too much luck for a game this long and heavy. But I guarantee anyone who doesn\\'t mind luck can enjoy this immensely. And I do too up to a point, Die Macher is certainly technically one of the most impressive games ever designed.  Classic. Chances to a lot of meta-play. Sometimes feels like work and not a game. Usually enjoyable with the right people Takes a bit too long to play, but is worth it.  I don\\'t like bidding too much, which is why I gave it such a low rating.  Perhaps I\\'ll warm up to it, if I play a little more. Long game, never could get it to hit the table. [5p] 4 plays.  Extremely heavy political game.  Very well balanced and thought out.  Often difficult to predict the end winner.  Long......Some kingmaking factor. Too heavy, but great game Valley games version This is the best cube management game I have played. Die Macher has a good theme (hey, who could resist German politics?) and the system offers endless possibilities for strategies and tactics. Negotiations and long term planning are the best things in this game. There is some luck involved but that is fine as it does not dominate the game. Oh, did I mention you can easily screw your neighbor? Liked by everyone I have played with. Only played 3 player so far.  It is interesting, but no matter how well you plan, someone can really mess you up.  But there are multiple ways to get points.  It would be very interesting to play with 5 players - coalitions would be much more important, but the chaos level would go way up. For what it is, this a very good game.  The depth and number of interactions is quite interesting; however, the multiple board rotations and game length detract from the overall experience.  The learning curve can be a bit steep, so getting 2 plays under your belt before playing it well is a serious investment in the game.  Overall, a good game, but might run long for some. I want to like this more.  It\\'s just too many systems to keep track of and if you miss one little fiddly thing, the whole 3.5 hours goes down the tubes when you realize it 2 turns later.  I\\'m sure it would be better if played with people that play this more often.  Don\\'t try with all noobs! I enjoyed my experience with this game, but it wasn\\'t the best game ever just because of it\\'s sheer length and complexity.  I didn\\'t like the amount of upkeep necessary to keep the game running, and I also didn\\'t like how the complexity felt very wide but not pinned together at a deep level.  I\\'d love to play it again now that I have a handle on it, unfortunately it\\'s size makes it prohibitive for most of my friends to learn it and devote 4-5 hours to playing a game. Every euro-gamer should play this once. Once was about right for me. tough to get players for.  The blind bidding aspect seems to be a little more random that ideal. 2 plays so far, but not with the same group.  I\\'m very interested in exploring this one further, but the long play time and need for 5 players has acted against it.  ----  A little too much luck for the length as an opinion poll can bury you but it\\'s still an engrossing experience that can be enjoyed once maybe once a year... Play this years ago with the original German edition.  Quite interesting rule mechanic since you have to balance various resources(votes, polls, fundraising).  Very hard to master. Great game! I just can\\'t rate it higher due to its length. It is not a game that I will ALWAYS say yes to, because I don\\'t always want to spend 5+ hours on one game. Doctor! Doctor! My brain hurts... Great game. A lot of nice ideas and it is at the top of a very short list of games featuring politics that are good but it takes about three times as long to play as it should.  It cries out for a second edition that streamlines the design. I just played this for the first time and I amazed at how great of a game this is.  I know it will be difficult to get the right number of people together who have the time to play this.  But it is certainly well worth it.  It took us 4.5 hours but the time really flew by. One of the original complex European games. I enjoy this quite a bit, but there are problems. First, the game takes 4 hours plus to play, meaning it gets to the table rarely. Second, it is an odd set of rules, difficult to remember and hard to grasp by newbies. This means that every game is a learning game.  It\\'s nearly impossible to tell who is winning during the game, a good thing as far as I am concerned. But the negatives (including the subject matter...difficult to get people excited to play!) make it unlikely I will play it anytime soon. Too bad. Only to be played with the right group. Some issues with political platform cards that has spawned more than one house rule in my former regular group of gaming buddies.  BGG rating: 7 Rating just on game play/enjoyment: 8  Finally got to play.  Really enjoyed it but what a brain burner.  There is so much going on.  Nice to play every once in a while, but I just feel it\\'s too luck based for the amount of playing time one game takes. A grail game for me.  Top of my list for games I want to play.  I love the political theme. 2nd edition: Too long and I hate the  new rules for the opinion cards cool game  Why watch the Godfather when you could watch some other gangster movie in nearly half the time? Oh, right. OT First play was intriguing, lots to pick up but truly not a rule-complex game.  I think this game would be an even bigger hit if it was U.S. politics. [b]Die Macher[/b] [i]Karl Heinz Smichael 1986[/i] A fantastic game, the best political game ever created and not as complex as people use to think. You can really play ahead and have a strategy in this wonderful design that despite its age it is still as fresh as any novelty, in fact its mechanics are more innovative than most of the new games published in the last years. It is a crying shame that the three editions are so ugly because this gem deserves better looks. I apply four special rules: a) in the last election you are allowed to promote only one card to the national board in order to reduce the impact of this very last election; b) bidding affects all the positions in the turn order not just one; c) you can socre +50 votes; and d) there are some restrictions to the change of political ideas phase. A fantastic euro that you must reall try at least once. Probably a lot of fun when you play with folks who know it.  My first time was with three other newbies, and it didn\\'t go so well... Excellent & long. A low seven simply bacause it takes about a million hours to learn the game. Otherwise brilliant. I want to play it more. I feel that this could be a game I\\'d really enjoy, but there\\'s too much time between the games, so I never learn the rules properly. Wow.  This game is great.  Lots of decisions.  However, My first play was with a german board.  I really wish that English printings had as much production value as german ones. Massive, long, complex, and very \"German\" game. Worth playing as an experience. The euro gamer\\'s equivalent of the New York Marathon. Received in trade for Pandemic and Star Munchkin + Expansion. 8/12 - traded away for A Few Acres of Snow. You aren\\'t a true BoardGameGeek unless you\\'ve played Die Macher. A lot of work, and a bit too much luck in the end, but still a worthy complex game. Drags for too long for what is essentially repetitive play. It sure was cool to own the #1 id\\'d game on BGG. Seems like a cool concept, but the Comic Sans on the cards and pieces was just too much. What an eyesore. Still, I understand why this game was considered to be the \"granddaddy\" of the modern eurogame. I\\'ve been meaning to try Die Macher for a long time but not found an occasion. A Sunday in August (09) saw five of us gather together at my place armed with player aids, bratwurst and sauerkraut. For all its fearsome reputation, the gameplay is reasonably smooth, broken up into lots of little phases, and we only screwed up one rule. The integration of mechanics with theme is what really makes the game hang together for the 4-5 hours it takes to play, even if that theme is German regional elections! It took a few rounds to begin to understand what I was supposed to be doing, and I\\'m definitely keen to give it another go now my head has recovered. A very interesting game, but very long playing.  It is hard to rate it -- it is long enough that I don\\'t want to play it that often, but an excellent game, with much richness of choice and far too many things going on, often in opposition to each other. JAN 2009 - Eugene Games Gala - Wow! This is a pretty cool game. Lots of decisions to make/options to consider. Interesting mix of aligning with other people and yet trying to ultimately win out over them at the same time. Many, many possibilities for replayability.   This game is not for everyone...it\\'s very long and might be a little dry with the political tilt. However, if you like highly complex games with lots of possibilities to mess with other people, this is the game for you.  For me, I very much enjoyed it, but it\\'s not a game I would want to play all the time. Once in a while would be fine. This is one of the first games I bought when I started collecting in 2005, but I haven\\'t played it until now.   We played a 5-player game with mostly beginners, took us 6 hours.   This is a really good game, but I need some more games in me before I give it a higher rating.   I like complex games, and this is really complex, in a very good way, but you need af ew games to get the hang on planning ahead.  4/6/17: A solid 4 hour game. Interesting, but with AP folks this could really slow down.  At the end bidding for polls gets exponential because there is nothing else to spend money on, and a bad one can hurt you at a critical time.  Also trying to change your stance on issues, can be very frustrating.  Towards the end everyone converges on the same stance on issues as you don\\'t want to be an outlyer.  The luck factor felt higher than I\\'d like it it to be, which usually isn\\'t a complaint for me, but I guess that\\'s the point of multiple election cycles, to even things out.  Probably also with additional playing you learn how to manage and minimize adverse events.  I do not like the iconography of the Valley games (3rd) edition.  It is hard to distinguish the symbols from across the table.  I may need to make alternate cards for my copy of that edition.  5 players is really the best way to play this game.  Also consider doing just 5 election cycles rather than 7. In the Netherlands. Billy and I won this in a BGG auction (Jan 2014), yay! Heavy game with lot of depth. Looking forward to next session. ɅV Obtained in trade, looking forward to trying it out soon. Played game solitaire, to learn rules, then with my niece both of us playing 2 parties each, we had a great time but this game is soooo complicated multi-player so playing with one other opponent handling 2 parties apiece is just too much, I look forward to the day I can play a real game with at least 3 or preferably 5 players with all 5 parties in play. I backed the kickstarter for the new version of this game. In my humble opinion the older version has better quality components, I only want to hold on to the new version because it had some extras in the KS version, which is useless with the older version, and... Hell I paid good money for the KS version... LOL!!! Super Euro. Bland theme and somewhat abstract but it works well.  While this game really has a lot going on, it all seems to tie together very well.  Players are attempting to get votes in various regions by setting up party meetings and gaining multipliers, though either issues or public opinion.  There\\'s a lot of future planning in this game, as players can see (though not perfectly) how upcoming elections will go for them.  I like the option of being able to lock in your votes early; not being able to lock up an election win early prevents this from being abusive.  That said, I wish there was a way to streamline this game somewhat, so players wouldn\\'t get caught up trying to analyze 20 different factors when making each decision.  Additionally, the money got a little ridiculous toward the end of the game, when the quantity of it greatly increased and the usefulness of it greatly decreased.  (1 play) I like the theme because it is really unique, but the game time is just too long. Perhaps the new shortplay rules will make it even better. The game mechanics work fine and offer a lot, but it is nevertheless hard to plan everything and so still quite luck dependant. pretty dry political game, but challenging. there is opportunity for plenty  of interesting scheming and twists. longish game (easily 4+ hours). lots of different bidding mechanics and blind maneuvering. sold on BGG market place. The epic Euro. Much too long to get a very high rating but it\\'s a very nice \"event\" game. It really gives you the feeling of playing politics on Mars- er, in Germany. The intricacies are many, and at first it\\'s all you can do to try to make any sense of it. For me things started coming together around the fourth or fifth round after which I was completely crushed, leaving me trying to figure out just how I could have protected my lost glory, and what I could do better next time. My tolerance for long games must be improving because I want to play this again.  2nd game (9 months later): a win! Scoring all five media cubes was key. I\\'d love to get this out more often, it\\'s absolutely the best 3-4 hour game I\\'ve ever played, and basically the only one worthy of that kind of time commitment. Too fiddly, didn`t care for the theme, very ugly and too long, even so, it`s the best politcs around I really enjoyed playing this. It was a long game, as 3 of us were learning to play, but well worth it.  There is some luck in what issues come up and how they match various platforms and in the card draw, but there is a lot of planning, strategy, and skill involved that dominates play. I enjoyed this a lot, but the length has to pull down the rating a bit for me.  Not something I\\'d play often, just for that reason. Oh, thats a very good game. Thinky. A lot of intertwining choices. Tactical and tight \\'til the end. As a plus we got our 1st game done in 4 hours (after hearing stories of 6-7 hours sessions of it). I did enjoy my first playing of this game, but wasn\\'t blown away. Definitely willing to try again, though it will be difficult to find the time for it. I\\'d have to play this again to have any clue what I was doing.  I valued a lot of elements incorrectly.  Nevertheless it was a very fun experience with interesting decisions.  The mechanics and the unexpected insights of the theme were very enjoyable. Very good game.  Is it time for my pinko\\'s to grow their members? Great game. It shines over most contemporary games. I like the theme, that every rule try to act some behaviour from real life. You can feal like a real political leader. That is great.  But... Game is not so quick, it could take ~3h. Unfortunatelly after all that time you can\\'t win without more luck than your opponents. I expect from long games, that gives me more control of my final result.  Still, there is something in this game, that i probably will play it again. (And  complain again perhaps.)  Want to play this, but not sure if I will ever get a full complement of players. Based on a single play:  There was quite a lot that I liked here but the rating is dragged down by the playtime. 5 new players took a bit over 4 hours. I generally prefer my games in the 2 hour range so I can\\'t really say \"I would never turn down this game\" like an 8-rating suggests. Sometimes I\\'m just not up for a 4+ hour game. And I doubt I would ever play this often enough with the same group of people to get the play time down much.  Despite the long play time you\\'re not saddled with heaps of downtime the way Through The Ages is. It was one of the easiest playing \"long\" games I\\'ve played -- and that was with 5 new players!  The game is fairly complicated with lots of inter-relations between bits of the game and various players. Too much for any of us to keep straight at all times. Perhaps with more play you\\'d begin to see patterns to it?  I have some misgivings about the use of randomness in the game: the game is long enough, and the uses of randomness infrequent enough, that it feels like it could have a huge impact on the game with not enough room to compensate. The difference between a +3 and a -2 on the state currently up for election can be massive. But that\\'s just based on a single play.  Definitely a game I\\'d play again but the length and number of players means it is unlikely I\\'ll do it anytime this year. Amazing game. But theme is boring and game is too long for me. 2015年10月購入\\u3000￥8,000 2018年9月放出 ¥8,250 Landmark Game Very well designed Euro with the worst theme and components imaginable.  The mechanics felt very disconnected from the theme to me.  However, the fact that this game came out in 1986 is absolutely incredible. A háborús játékokon kívül a BGG legösszetettebb játéka. Jogosan érdemelte ki ezt a címet, ami a német politika választásról szól. Nagyon sok mechanizmus, nagyon sok figyelembevevendő feltétel és előrelátás szükségessége jellemzi a Die Machert. Nekem a téma és a megvalósítása száraznak tűnt, az első játékos jogért menő licitálást meg valahogy nem értettem. Pont elsőnek lenni volt rossz érzésem szerint a játékban. Jó játék a Die Macher, de valahogy végig olyan érzésem volt játék közben, hogy inkább játszanék egy Caylussal, egy Age of Empiressel ha már nehéz játékot kellene választani egy délutánra, mint ezzel. Ettől függetlenül akit a téma érdekel és szereti a komplex, gondolkodós játékokat, annak mindenképp ajánlható. Finally managed to play this game a last. Some things seemed weird: the randomness of the dice, the zero value of money at the end of the game, the fact that each election doesn\\'t have a winner (PR I guess?).  But still it is a huge and deep design, that necessarily has a very steep learning curve. Ultimately, I\\'m in favour, but with some reservations.   Box Damaged. Components Good  Iconography makes this a chore. An older game it shows its age in the length of time it takes to play. Love the theme of the game.  It\\'s long, which makes it much less likely for me to play it, but there is little downtime. Strategic and tactical decisions abound. Played my first game, managed to get in three turns before we stopped.  Wow, many moving parts in this game. I think I got a hang of things towards the end.  Score may improve after a few more games. Acquired mostly for nostalgia sake as it was the first \"deep\" game I played at my first BGG con. Fun game but probably won\\'t see the table very often. I liked how thematic this was, but is a bit too long.  I think 1960 captures the same tension in less time. First Impression: This is a game about blocking your opponents actions and ability to generate VPs. The interplay of mechanisms is well done but the theme seems inconsequential. This is definitely a brainburner game. In a word - the granddaddy of the euros  Investment Required - fairly high: it will take a few sessions to understand the game objective; the rules are quite weighty, also  Return - substantial: conveys some sense of electoral politics, though its integration is pretty mechanical; also, the game certainly features more strategic depth than the typical euro  Co-dependency - moderate (there is plenty of negotiation, but a weak player is likely to be marginal in a five-player session)  Compares to . . . Tammany Hall, which I believe provides a better return. I was a bit surprised on my first play of this old classic. Given the hype from heavy Euro gamers, I was expecting something a little different.   I really enjoyed the challenge and the interesting decisions that have to be made. There\\'s a lot of food for thought on this one. What took me for a surprise was the amount of luck and volatility that I experienced given the length and weight of the game. One card alone can swing the score significantly. It reminded me a bit of Dominant Species; although I thought that Dominant Species\\' chaos can be mitigated better.  I\\'m wondering if this game came out today would it still hold up as a classic...  Anyways, because these are musings based on a first play, I want to get it to the table again to confirm my thoughts and to give it the chance it deserves. There\\'s a lot of interesting things going on in this game and I\\'m wondering if a neophytes view is clouding my opinion and what seems luck and chaos turns into something that can be controlled.   Still, I\\'m going with a provisional rating of 7.5 due to my enjoyment of the game and the opportunity for clever play. Also, for the fact that despite it\\'s long playtime, time passes by quickly as you are very involved in the game.   Le jeu est quand meme assez simple malgré sa longueur. J\\'ai trouvé qu\\'il y avait des éléments peu controlable (les cartes qu\\'on pige, ou on est assis par rapport au leader qui décide du 1er joueur). L\\'iconographie est simplement affreuse - certaines cartes sont difficiles à différencier.  Je devrai le rejouer quand je serai en meilleur forme (j\\'avais une sinusite), mais je suis partagé. Un peu long pour ce que c\\'est. Very well designed approach to \\'electioneering\\'. It\\'s an abstracted approach that focuses on the issues and strategies of gaining popular support. It doesn\\'t give you the context and geography of a federal election, which is a small point against it, IMO, but doesn\\'t serioulsy detract from the great game that is here. Way too long and fiddly. End game national elections can make the state elections seem almost pointless.  The rules are a bit fiddly. Especially the order of the different phases is not really supported by the theme. And very long playingtime. A heavy, highly involving game. If you don\\'t like political systems, as I do, you will probably hate Die Macher. But personally I really love it. :star::star::star::star::nostar::nostar: [b]- Good! Definitely willing to play again.[/b]  So much going on in this game. I would love to play again soon. Very interactive and challenging to play well. Fascinating game.  You are constantly involved so the time flies.  Took us about 7 hours with 3 newbies and 2 experienced teaching it.  I enjoyed it even while I was losing dreadfully during the first half game.  I did better in the second half and finished 3rd out of 5. I would happily play this any time. Its a good game but can suffer from a little randomness.  I find it an acceptable amount for a shorter game but this is a long game.  Group of 4 took 4 hours but with new players.  The game does overstay its welcome as each round is just a repeat of the last. It is really good, but not something I want to play very often. Could use some small updates, but it surprisingly doesn\\'t feel 30+ years old. Det är något långt. Mikael. Very elegant mechanics - the game plays and feels like a modern euro. The icons for the various issues could be better and more clear though. Mayorías insulsas. No transmite política en gran medida. Creo que en otra casa o mesa de juego lo disfrutarán más. Vendido. Backed on kickstarter 1st Impressions: I didn\\'t love this game, but I was also very tired when we played so perhaps I just had a bad first play. It seemed hard to grock and the timing was super important but not at all easy to remember. Other than that, I did see the potential for a lot of interactive maneuvering. I just can\\'t tell if the amount of chaotic changes is too much or if I just need to get better at the game. May raise or lower in rating after more plays. I\\'m going to prioritize giving it another try. Fun heavy area control. Long term and short terms goals are fun.  There is an awful lot to like here, but I can\\'t help thinking that the game is feeling its age a bit.  I would love to see a somewhat streamlined reimplementation of the core ideas. Vin d\\'jeu: french review of Die Macher: https://www.vindjeu.eu/2019/11/10/die-macher/ A classic, that is a deserved title for a game that dates from 1986 and still gets reprinted and played decades later. I have the Spielworxx-version and while the artwork maybe typical Spielworxx/Lieske, it fars from you invite to play this game. The quality of the paper seems poor and I don’t understand the choice of the paper sheets: a board with the same info, a scoretrack and player screens to hide your money and cards would be far more practical.  The game itself: this game can withstand the test of time, but it’s not that it blows me away and that I actively wanna play this a couple of times. What bothers me the most is the player order. If I bid 10.000, but my direct left neighbour makes the highest bid with 11.000, I still will be last in turn order and especially when putting down media markers and playing that special card to manipulate things, I will be screwed big time. The bidding system from Age of Steam would be far more better imho, seen the importance of turn order in certain phases (it would off course increase the playing time even more). Never played a game like this. Almost feels like an area control game. Took me a few elections to work out a strategy but it has a really clear flow that almost runs itself but you have to think several rounds ahead.   Does feel a bit repetitive after a while although I think an experienced group could pump this out in around 3 hours, maybe less. Deep nerd stuff, as Ice T would say. We played the old 7 election first English edition with comic sans rulebook and a CDRom. That says all about the graphic design. But the game is sexy as hell. I can see the selling points, but: 1) While not *horribly* long, it is longer than I like them, and it\\'s very much a lather-rinse-repeat kind of game. 2) The polls and their ridiculous randomness. For all its fiddly rules, Die Macher is very much a German game, which makes a mechanic that would be more a home in AH\\'s Kingmaker all the more distracting. SUM FUN It\\'s very long and features auctions and area influence, two mechanics that generally do not appeal to me. Otherwise, the design seems somewhat advanced for its time period. Always seems to be a bit slow, maybe need to play more to appreciate the subtleties. German politics Heavy game and you have to get in the sequence/rhythm, otherwise you might struggle for cash. *** played again after several years, it\\'s a heavy game! Long, more of a sim than a game. There\\'s not much politics really, much more on the placing of meetings and controling media. It\\'s interesting to see how much publishing or supressing an opinion poll matters. It can really damage your opponents, unless they control the media, in which case they cannot suffer a negative affect! How true! I\\'ll play this again, but I\\'m not desperate. A tremendous game, full of nuance and strategy, negotiation, calculation. However, and this is a big blocker: it\\'s very long. Longer than most any Euro you will ever play. Twice as long, in fact. Maybe three times, if you have the \"wrong\" group. Still enjoy the game, but dropped the rating as there are other long games I enjoy more. Played once, but it is really good.  It took us 4 newbies awhile to play but was worth it and generally didn\\'t \"feel\" long. Thanks to boardgames with Scott for his video. Les ha faltado poco para hacer un juego redondo. Muy interesante manera de simular el mundo de las elecciones políticas. Tendría que estudiarse variantes para mejorar el sistema de coaliciones y hacerlo menos abstracto. Well made game, good components (except for the Comic Sans MS font in the Valley Games rulebook) decent gameplay. A little long, but rewarding. That said, if I\\'m going to play games for four hours, there are other games which I\\'d rather play. High marks for design and almost everything else - my rating is just because... well, I\\'d rather play something else most of the time. Interesting and worth playing but overrated on BGG.   I feel that the slim possibility (which I\\'ve experienced) of getting just flat screwed by not getting any position cards that coincide with the elections or national opinion is unacceptable in a five-hour game.  However, I also think [person=1]Schmiel[/person] has pretty well nailed the feel of an election process.  Brilliant machinery in this game! Had a chance to finally play this one - Very Dry! Strong theme though... I will have a hard time try to get this one to the table often. Tentative rating. Played once. Intriguing, but I\\'m not sure if it\\'s interesting enough to warrant the time and effort. Traded for Tigris & Euphrates  Initial Impression; limited plays.   Only played the short game so far.  I think the full game will significantly add to (and improve) the game, but I\\'m unsure if it will be worth the time investment. 1st play: Over 6 hours. Will have to try this again now that I know how to play it.  1 play.  It was good, but I felt like it was impossible to really plan anything due to the weight of the card draws and how easy it was to roll double zeroes.  I won the game only game I played, but I think it was luck, which is what I didn\\'t like about it. I enjoyed my one playing, but there was a bit too much randomness in the poll phase.  For all the work you put into the game, you can get really screwed seemingly at random.  I\\'d play it again, but probably not more than once a year. My rating is probably too low; I partly feel like I should hold off rating until I play another game of it.  But this feels like a \"like it, don\\'t love it\" situation.  It is very Euro-y for sure.  Very long, and a lot of balls to keep in the air.  Closest comp for me would be Dominant Species, which is more complicated, but which I liked more; both have a very no-frills approach to visual design, which I\\'m not crazy about.  Die Macher is very, very fluid, almost abstract, more so than I expected.  I would have liked to see a little more stability, a little more cross-over from one election to another.  Given the time commitment and the need for at least 4 players, I can\\'t see myself playing it very often; if I\\'m going to play one game for 4 hours, it\\'ll probably be Arkham Horror.  But playing another game where I know what I\\'m doing from the get-go would be helpful. Consider the rating provisional. Heavy euro from days of yore about manipulating German state elections. Players control political parties vying for seats in seven successive elections, each in a different region, with seats translating to points and other benefits. There are half a dozen ways to build up seats, but the key one is manipulating the issues. Each region is either for or against four of seven hot-button political issues (genetic engineering, nuclear power etc.); tailoring your party\\'s platform to match, or at least not directly contradict, increases your score multiplier. But it might be simpler to acquire control of the media and simply change the public\\'s mind...  The best part is that four of the elections are in play at once. While others squabble over the election being resolved right now, you can be laying the groundwork for crushing victories elsewhere.   There\\'s more to it than just the elections but it is not outrageously complex -- certainly no more difficult than a modern uber-euro like Trajan or Terra Mystica.  If it\\'s harder to play than your standard Feldian mishmash it\\'s because it is open, opaque and somewhat uncertain. Attempting to divine other players\\' plans for particular regions is critical. Actions are scarce enough that attending to one battle will leave several unaccounted for. While the cat\\'s away...  My biggest problem with the game is the randomness, both in regional issues and in the opinion polls. Parties have only limited ability to change platform and some will be more naturally aligned with important regions than others. Opinion polls are auctioned off blind before each election and can increase or decrease party popularity [i]multipliers[/i] by as much as -3x or +4x -- a swing of plus or minus 20 votes, from a total of 50, is huge. But for each poll card, each bracket (+3, +2, +1, -1, -2) applies to a named party. If you win the card that can sends Die Linke up +3 and the SPD -2, that\\'s great if you\\'re Die Linke and want to move up -- not so good if you\\'re the SPD and want the same thing.  These elements are arguably thematic and do ratchet up the tension, but it\\'s all a dice roll too far for a 4-5 hour game.  I enjoy Die Macher as an experience game but I understand why most people say they like to play it once a year. Feels like one or two subsystems too many.  Mechanics meld well into a whole but so much to manage starts to feel like work. Influential game based around a series of resource management mini-games. It moves along quickly, but it takes a while to actually finish. I believe enjoyment increases if every player is familiar with strategic games.  I\\'d like to get another game in, but it\\'s hard to pick this one over some other 4 hour games.  It feels like a once-a-year treat. 老遊戲似乎躲不掉運氣值太高的問題..加上又是個長時間的重策遊戲，媒體的操弄殺傷力是太大了..另外美術太差啦～ Great game, but poor production, anyway I liked. An 8 with the 1 play I have. Played 1 time. Look forward to trying again. First game learnign took a lot out of me, but now I think I\\'d enjoy it more. Intense game which is perhaps a little dry and goes on too long to be a regular in the rotation. The opinion polls introduce too much luck in the game in a place where it does not fit well.  But creative idea. And generally enjoyable to play. Game of German politics and parliament. Too long for me. One of the more impressive German board games ever. Lots of things to do, really no downtime during the four hours - you must keep on thinking all the time, you can\\'t just hang along. Constant reacting to changing environment, lots of tough decisions. Still, after not playing a single game for four years, I sold mine... Not attractive enough, I suppose. Long games are a bit of a problem for me and whenever I get room for longer games, there\\'s been something else I\\'d rather play.  Indifferent. Long game with a lot going on... Good game but very long and not easy to learn. Seems to work fine, and obviously has some hardcore fans... but I don\\'t feel you\\'re really getting a lot of extra quality here for all the extra complications.  Would probably like better if I got to play more often. Mmmm - it may be great, but you probably need the rules taught to you to make it work.  I felt like I\\'d earned a Scout badge when I learned this one from the BGG posted rules.. Great theme, very involved and engrossing game, BUT has some significantly flawed random elements to the game (opinion polls, secret auction for first player).  Also, although this needs more than 1 play to really appreciate/properly rate this game, how likely is it that you\\'re going to get at least 3 people to sit down for another 6-8 hour game again (especially if someone got burned by the randomness of the game the first time)?  Unfortunately, this game will probably be forever retired after 1 play. first edition for 4 players  This game is quite long.  I don\\'t think it is top-10 material... but I have only played one time (when I first started Eurogaming in 2003).  I need to play it again. I never thought I\\'d ever be interested in playing politics until I played Die Macher.  It has a heck\\'va learning curve (at least for me) and I think, after a couple of games, I\\'m still not very good at it.  It is a brain burner and I usually get fried after each playing of it b/c of all the nuances and countermoves I have yet to fully learn.  I only seem to play this once every three years or so b/c there are other long games I prefer to have fun with. Kill many machers in this game. Crush! Destroy! DIE MACHER!!!!!!!  I\\'m now up to two plays ... the game balances marvelously and so many mechanisms interact that\\'s it is actually rather difficult to keep it all in head, even with two plays.  Brilliant stuff though.  Will likely go up with time. Played, but I think I need a few more playings before I get a solid \"I like\" or \"I don\\'t like\" this game. It\\'s a strange animal Great game, but length and complexity makes it hard to get to the table. After 5 plays, I\\'m not excited about playing again, but would under the right conditions. Sure, the game is well put together and works as a system. However, I\\'m not sure the 4 hours payoff is worth it for what is essentially an area control game with multiple ways to score.  I don\\'t really get the feel of changing opinions and running the machinations of political jostling. The game gives the illusion of long term planning and strategy yet some of it\\'s mechanics seem counter that. For example: public opinions for future regions aren\\'t completely revealed. Players who decide to invest in future regions (media markers, etc) are essentially gambling on what\\'s flipped over. The dice are a really bad idea (tie breaking is silly). The bidding may go high for opinion polls that seem to have too much of a random swing.  Somehow, the game is hyped. Why? I put it down to nostalgia and gaming snobbery. I do agree that the 4 hours passes pretty smoothly but I\\'d rather play a few other games or a longer game with more tension and dynamic structure.   Owned 2nd edition, traded. Bought 3rd ed. I think the theme is cool, and the length of the game doesn\\'t bother me too much.  It\\'s just too fiddly and requires too much cognition for me.  Trying to see which players match or don\\'t match on what issues just requires too much looking back and forth between cards with similar pictures for example.  Maybe this would be a good candidate for playing as a computer game with a really nice interface quickly telling you all the things that need to be constantly calculated.  Anyway I\\'d definitely recommend it for any Euro fan that doesn\\'t mind a long game. Big game with a lot going on, but as other reviews have mentioned, you don\\'t realize how fast time is passing. Takes quite a bit of planning to get this to the table with the right set of folks. As a game system this is outstanding.  The theme truly feels like it comes through in the gameplay, but this can also be a negative.  The bitter struggle for political power seems to encourage backstabbing and merciless attempts to crush your opponents, making Die Macher a political \"wargame\".  The 5-6 hour playtime is what really lowers the ranking for me though, as there are only 7 (six really) turns which take a LONG time to complete.  I\\'ll admit that shorter \"euros\" are more my thing in general, but I wish this game took less time to play.  For the time commitment, I\\'d rather play 3-4 games of El Grande. Long but involving political game on German politics. Glad that I eventually got to try this classic Euro and there is a lot to like - clever interlocking mechanisms with loads to think about and good theme engagement.  There are however some negatives - there is huge amounts of random in the game, too much for one of this length. There are some really swingey  VP awards which can also be determined by the chance turn of a card. The worst offenders are the \\'Opinion Poll\\' cards which occur after everything else in a region and which have to be bid on blind. There are dice to give income (which also translates to VP at game end) and there is some way OP\\'d \\'take-that\\' effects on the Shadow Cabinet cards.  I am OK with some random and quite like steering a course through chaos, but this is all just too much for the length and thinkeyness of the game. There\\'s lots of accidental screwage and unintended shafting amongst the deliberate \\'take-that. Also, although the theme is well engaged with, the theme itself is not quite appealing enough to generate a narrative to allow you to ignore the random elements.  I suspect it was amazing when it first came out but it hasn\\'t aged that well. Die Macher is a genuine \"gamer\\'s game.\" With its complex rules and strategies and its great length, it is not a good choice for inexperienced or casual gamers. For myself, I think it\\'s a good game but too long and fiddly for the amount of fun. I also prefer games where I can build something and rely on it; in Die Macher there are a million ways for the other players to mess with everything you try to do. Pretty good game.  Lots of options and choices to be made in this complex resource management game.  It\\'s kind of uninspiring and I found my interest really waning towards the end despite the game being undecided and myself still in the running.  Mechanical. It does have excellent long term planning required, however, Louis XIV accomplishes many of the same things in less time.  I like long games, but only if they hold my interest throughout. You are the head of a German political party allocating resources over a series of elections.  Finally got to play this one.  I was disappointed but I think that\\'s probably because I had such high expectations.  It\\'s a fine game and I\\'d be happy to play again, but it wasn\\'t as engrossing as I had expected it to be, and I won\\'t be asking for it myself. After 1 play but I would love to get the chance to play again. The rules and play length are a bit scary, but there is a lot to think about and I do love the theme. I think it is only worth playing with 5 players.   There is a lot to take in and think about. I don\\'t like the randomness of the opinion poll cards- it would be better if you knew what you were bidding on, so you could value it properly.  Bought Spring 2006 1 play.  I was engaged for the whole 6 hours.  I want to play again.  All the mechanisms are simple, but figuring out how they mesh is going to be a challenge. First Game: I was very excited to play the game after seeing Scott\\'s presentation of the game in Boardgameswithscott.com.  It played very differently from what I had imagined the game play would flow.  Seems just like an area majority game where you try to get a piece of the pie all of the time.  Seems like as long as you do ok with the votes you will be fine.  It kinda feels like Princes of Florence how the extra 3 points from making the best work is so key that you pretty much revolve your game around it, but here it is all about getting your media marker and public opinion up in the national board.  I just thought there would be more manuevering and back door political shenanigans.  I don\\'t know.  I will try more and see how the game goes. Initial Rating: 6 Very well done.  In the new addition, there are two similar symbols that have a crane.  Pointing this out at the beginning will help avoid hurt feelings later.  You can also suggest doing what I do, which is to focus on the white tower (that only appears on one card).  Player aids are a life-saver (be sure to check for accuracy). I finally got to play this game.  First impression:  I like the game, but it\\'s a little dry and much, much too long.  There is a great mix of skill and luck... the opinion polls, expecially, add a nice random element to the game otherwise it would be really boring.  Money could be a bit tighter but, in the game I played, we just didn\\'t spend as much as we probably should have on many of the auctions.  I think that I\\'d play again under the right conditions but, because of its length,  it\\'s not a game that I\\'d put on my Top 10 List.  If the game were re-themed and redeveloped to last only five rounds, I think that it would definitely find an bigger audience. (I have heard that the Valley Games edition has a 5 round variant... must check it out)  If it\\'s on the table, I\\'d love to play again.  It\\'s a little boring because of its length, which can cause a bit of downtime, so I really can\\'t rate it much higher.  An average game at most. Ok game, very complex and lots of decisions to make.  Fantastic player interaction.  That being said, i could play it again but wouldn\\'t be sad if i didn\\'t play it a lot again.  Not sure why, i guess i hoped it would be more simulationy for the complexity level.  Creates bad blood between the players competing since everyone is intensly involved. Die Macher features stunningly disparate game mechanisms, jumbled into a procedural nightmare, baked and fried into a 4-5 hour game that\\'s like nothing else out there. This could easily go down to 7. I didn\\'t enjoy the luck elements, but even worse was the tedious walk through every step of the round. A streamlined, elegant rules set would make this a better game, but it also might take away a lot of what gives the game character. For now, though, I am fascinated with all of the interlocking parts, even if it does make Die Macher a bit of a Frankenstein\\'s Monster.   One of the first \"heavy\" Euros.  It\\'s decent, but there are many games I\\'d rather play in that time slot. The satisfaction returned on time investment is not good enough. Very nice game but not for everyone. Took us a while to finally decide to play it but it will see more plays in the future.  It a neat game and I\\'m glad I own it.  The random elements though are very strong and frequently the game comes down to getting lucky on one card.  That is a very frustrating experience with a game this long. Ok, so my temporary rating is based on a sketchy training game learnt at 5.30am...on a 24 hour roleplay. In other words...not relaiable. It did seem like to solve most of your issues you could just throw money at it, and everyone could put max people into things... Very good deep strategy game but while I don\\'t mind games of this length, they need have a little less repetitiveness for them to really shine. And the Valley Games implementation is really poor with their choice of card icons which are far too similar. (I also own the original 4p version) I want to play!  Just have to come up with the folks to do it... First Play: Watched board game with Scott and had detailed explanation pre-game which helped enormously but I don\\'t think anything can prepare you for the next 5 hours.  It is without doubt a detailed and clever game, certainly heavy but there was for me a drowning sensation as I was unable to take opportunities,  and watched the other players racking up scores that I missed out on time after time.  Half way through and I have to admit that I wasn\\'t enjoying myself. I felt like a spectator as others formed coalitions, restructured the policies and seemed to be sculpting the game in their prefered form while I tagged behind. With hindsight my policies seemed to be out of step with the others but either through inexperience or bad luck, I never shared 3 common policies with any other player.  Being a hater of dice I really disliked the roll of the adjusted die (0-3) to add seats. As seats score points this makes a massive difference and I would gauge a difference of 10-15 points between players that is no more than a lucky bonus. The bidding for the opinion pole is also a major lottery. I appreciate that you need to win it to ensure bad results don\\'t fall your way, but frequently optimum results fell to one player whilst others were left with little choice but to enter the second lottery with the dice and the seats bonus.  In summary, I\\'m confused as to whether I like it or not. On the plus side its deep and theres alot going on. On the negative there is far more luck than I am happy with and so much of the game seems out of your control.   Post Script: With so many new and better games to play I have traded this on and down rated to a 6. Rating based on one play so take it with a grain of salt. My next play will probably move the rating one way or another. Lost some brain cells playing it for the first time from 1-4 in the morning. Deserving of more play. It didn\\'t feel heavy to me. Way too long for what it offers.  Good brain-burning, however.  I\\'m sure I\\'ll give it another chance, but so far the game doesn\\'t excite me the way I thought it would.   Played it once and enjoyed it. Gotta play more times to see just how much I like it. UPDATE: Yes, it\\'s a classic, but it remains impenetrable to me. I will burn remaining brain cells on wargames, but not on this.   An exceedingly deep and complex Eurogame that transcends the boundaries of traditional Euros.  Beware the brain burn and dominance of the math fiends!  But obviously this game is worth multiple plays and some real thought.  Not as much negotiation as I would have hoped for in a game about politics, but that might have made a long game longer.  Rating likely to rise as I understand the system. Goddamn it, why is this not Republic of Rome?  Still a fun game, and I\\'d like to try again while knowing what\\'s possible. Everyone should play this game at least once. I can\\'t guarantee you\\'ll want to play it more than that, but it has a lot of interesting elements that work together surprisingly well. It is too long for what you get out of it for my tastes, but I will play it if everyone around wants to. I think the game repeats itself a bit too much during the couple of hours it lasts. It\\'s too long and lacks content for a game of 4 hours. 18 oct 07 Essen buying spree After almost 2 years I finally got to play this legendary game.  Initial rating: good game. Although I had expected a bit more. The final round seems to have a too big influence over the overall game. And there should be less dice-rolling, or more (to even out a bad roll) This first game with 5 took close to 5 hours, and for a game that long it should be a bit more thematic than pushing around cubes & betting... All the political porties are totally the same in this game, and although that\\'s certainly a cynical thought I can understand, I think it\\'s too far off reality to get the feeling you\\'re really working on elections here by \"trading\" all the simplistic pro/contra views on issues.  I like the interactivity, and the way the tension slowly builds, we didn\\'t have a dull moment. Basically the mechanics fit together nicely. But it just feels a bit too much of a long abstract with some luck thrown in.  But I\\'ll certainly be willing to play it again to see if my opinion of this game improves.  NL: lang spel wat ondanks het oersaaie thema (Duitse verkiezingen) goed in elkaar steekt. A classic! Select your gaming group carefully! Definitely not for the faint of heart - very AP prone. Had a blast playing the short version of this game with 5 players. Valley Games version. MUST GET PLAYER AIDS FOR THIS ONE! Tracked on family game list (grooven). Update: Lowered rating as I don\\'t have the time or inclination to ever choose to play this. One play.  Very nice game that I will play again at the drop of a hat.  The interactions between the mechanics are wonderfully intricate.  The theme really helps one understand the game and makes the game easy to explain to anyone who undestands how general elections work.  Valley Games edition cards are a great example of poor graphic design and the rule book...well they were having a laugh with the Comic Sans font from which you cannot escape - becomes tiresome to read.  However, the rule book content is excellent and I had no trouble at all learning this game.    Spiel 2007 purchase.  :star::star::star::star::star:  Good election game with full of subsystems.  High luck factore doesn\\'t bother me too much and it is a great game to play once in a while.  We played the 5-turn game with five players and I found it to be dull.  I don\\'t like election games much, but I did appreciate the complexity of the many different steps of each turn.  It was difficult to plan ahead.  The iconography/typography in the Valley Games version is atrocious and ugly.  I am thinking about checking out the HiG version if only to avoid the Comic Sans font. Provisional rating based on 2 plays.  Die Macher is a game that I\\'ve tried to like, but without much success.  Certainly I can respect its intricate mechanics, but it feels too long for what it is.  The theme is present, certainly, but it just doesn\\'t engage me.  There are so many other intense strategic games (Goa, AoS, El Grande, Princes of Florence, Traders of Genoa, etc.) that are shorter, more fulfilling, and simply more interesting. Ideal Players: 5  Description: Campaign for seats in six regions while trying to match nationally important issues and grow your political party.  Pro: Theme and mechanics match perfectly. Many interwoven mechanics require complex strategy. Randomly chosen regions make each game different. Resolving the last two elections at once forces a satisfying climax to end the game. Player interaction and politics play a large role.  Con: Graphics could be better. Game would be more personally involving with a US theme and current issues.  Wanted to play it for years.  Very heavy (I like that), but horribly random.  Will probably never play it again Auctions, area majority, negotiating, treachery, cooperative play, press your luck.  This game takes everything, puts it into a blender, and makes a fun, skillfull game out of it.     I personally have a disdain for longers games, but the 0 downtime and the well crafted rules and balance(i.e. this is not a fantasy flight game)  makes this a pleasure to play.  If you are reading this, you owe it to yourself to play this at least once.  I can not promise you will like it, but it is an experience that any \"boardgame geek\" should have.    Better than most long games, but I really need to be feeling the mood to play this.  High quality game, that I\\'d play occasionally.  Its not dynamic enough for the length.  Its a once a year kind of game for me.  An enjoyable time once a year, so for me that is a 6.  I do wish the money stayed tighter throughout the game and not just the first couple turns.   Others in the group enjoy this game more - I remember enjoying it more the first time I played, but couldn\\'t quite get as into it the last few. own valley games version2007-12-18 - traded away in a math trade.  i\\'ve played once and it was ok.  i was put off by one player consistently being screwed the whole game.  once she fell behind, there was no catching up, and there seemed to be a runaway leader problem.  maybe it was due to too much hype and too high expectations, but it didn\\'t really do that much for me.  also, a lot of my fellow gamers bought copies and i doubt i\\'ll ever play it with any one other than them, so i didn\\'t need it in my collection.  makes great trade fodder, btw :)  gets a couple of dings for length.  i\\'ll try it again.  maybe that\\'ll be a better experience, who knows.  for now, it gets a 6.  rating it to get it off my recommendation list so I can see others games on it. I must give this a 6 even though when playing it is enjoyable. I am not often in the mood as I dont feel I can warrant the long play time. The theme is undoubtedly a stumbling block for many players A very interesting gme with good concepts, but it just takes way tooooooo long (and I usually love games, that last long) The rate would be very higher if the game was faster. Maybe the 5 rounds variant would make it better in this way. The mechanics and rules are complex, but all makes sense around the theme. Played once. Difficult to remeber all the phases etc. After a couples of plays it will be second nature. Opinions change fast in this game, a lot of screwage and a lot of fun. After initial play I rate this a 9. The length of the game lowers the rating from a 10. Have yet to get this game on the table for play. Once I do, I\\'ll re-rate it.  After one play, I rate it a 6.  It is definitely a game that I need to give another play to, and it\\'s ranking may rise given another play. Wow.  This is a pretty heavy game.  I\\'ve only played it once, but I enjoyed it and I didn\\'t get bored or distracted even though it took a long time to play. Interesting design, but length means I am unlikely to play often. Seems very heavy on luck for the length of the game, between the issue cards, polls etc, but I would play it again. Use to feel like too complex of a game to get it to the table. Now, there\\'s just too many other games I\\'d rather play. I threatened to burn this game (it was my copy) after the first three times I played this game (and I actually won one of those).  It is a brilliantly designed game, that I simply do not enjoy very much.  It is a bit too cutthroat for my group, but most importantly, the final tally scoring has no bearing whatsoever on the theme and it obscenely anticlimactic after the election process. Not the most interesting theme but I can see there is a good game in there. I think this would work best once everyone knows what they are doing as the rules explanation can take quite a while in itself. Fun to play, but too long. The nice mechanics of this game have been redeveloped in several newer game designs which give the same satisfaction while being more elegant and streamlined. I would rate this higher than 9 if we actually played it more than once a year. At 4  hours we just don\\'t do this often enough. Another disadvantage is that you need exactly five players to do it right. I can\\'t imagine a better long game than this though.   Update: lowered to an 8 because it is just so involved that it is sometimes hard to take it all in. Maybe if I played it a bit more I would be able to better manage the disparate activities. I have also cooled a bit on some of the mechanics. I am not a big fan of negotiation and king-making and this game has a lot of it. The blind selections and high level of card luck can also be a bit annoying. It remains an 8 for the moment because I would be unlikely to refuse a session if someone locally planned one on a weekend. Update 2: I have lowered to a 7 as I am gradually tiring of long games in favour of more intense shorter and yet tactically deep experiences. Still a good game that I will play again though. Rating after one play.  Is almost certainly going to go up to 8 or down to 6 after another couple games (update: my basic lack of interest in getting a group together for this again can be blamed partially on the graphic design but primarily on the game itself, and until I play it again it\\'s down to a 6).  Huh, this is a funny one.  Initial feeling about the game is that it\\'s too light for its length.  The other heavily procedural game I\\'m familiar with, Dutch Dutch Revolution, strikes the balance right and makes me feel like almost every of the roughly 100 decision points in the game matters.  Here, I felt that about 50% of my choices were relatively obvious ones, and only about 10% required a really long think.  Due to a couple of beginner\\'s mistakes (mostly regarding media markers), I also spent a lot of time feeling helpless and hopeless waiting for this steamroller of a game to arrive at a point where I could jump back into the action.  The good news is that this is an \\'experience\\' game that really does deliver.  Every one of us felt immersed for the duration (about 5.5 hours).  It is without a doubt a really, really fun game.  Unfortunately, the Valley Games reprint of this title is a graphic design train wreck.  Worse, the poor design is frequently an impediment to gameplay.  To wit: a lot of the game is driven by opinion cards, of which there are seven basic types.  There are always around 30-40 of these cards in view at any time, and each player will want to refer to a large portion of them several times per turn.  The only thing distinguishing the cards is the image on them.  Two of these images are so similar that we are literally considering marking one set up with Sharpies or something to make it easier to tell them apart.  To add insult to injury, the images are amateurish 3D renderings that are so uninteresting that they basically all blend together.  Physical component quality is quite good and Valley Games should be applauded for its great work in this regard.  Update 5/7/08: I\\'ve finally gotten my hands on a copy of the HiG edition. Night and day. I\\'m not wild about the 3D art on the opinion and shadow cabinet cards (though it\\'s far superior to Valley\\'s work), but my criticisms end there. HiG\\'s art perfectly captures the spirit of this game, equal parts austere and comical, deadpan and tongue-in-cheek. One look at the KOALITION tile with its fantastic telephone icon, and everyone knows exactly what kind of game they\\'re playing. [2016.Feb.1] A classic that must be played by any board gamers. The downside of this game, however, is its overall length, which makes replayability questionable at best. I am glad that I got an opportunity to play it, but in the end it did not have a permanent place in my collection. (Traded away.)  :star::star::star::nostar::nostar: Vajon hány pontot ér egy olyan játék, mely kimenetelében 5 órai kemény küzdelem után az utolsó kártya 180 fokos fordulatot hozhat? Un come cocos gigante !! Buen juego, pero necesita algunos cambios para hacerlo más ágil, unos colores para diferenciar las cartas le vendrían muy bien. La mecánica es genial ! Tras la segunda partida mi impresión sobre el juego mejora, pero no lo suficiente como para cambiarle la nota. No me negaría a jugarlo cada cierto tiempo, y de hecho reconozco que se trata de un jueguito muy bien hecho. Esta partida la jugué en un ambiente mucho mejor para la comida de coco que supone una partida al DM, razón por la que acabé entendiendo mucho mejor todos los detalles y mecánicas del juego, pero el problema de los símbolos que se usan para las cartas persiste, este juego necesita un rediseño con códigos de colores para los temas de las cartas, es abrumador mirar las cartas de cada jugador, las del estado que se está jugando y las de la opinión general ... con un código de colores este juego ganaría muchísimo. Interesting how you get VP - in the a round you`re fighting for votes and than depending on the conversion rate for a state you get for your votes VP.   Don`t like biding for a card, but you don`t know what is on the card.  The turns are very similar and repetitious, so the long game (7 round) is to long. 2008-08-17 A complex game for true gamers. Very rewarding for those who are willing to invest the time to learn the secrets of Die Macher.  The biggest minus comes from the rather big luck factor for such a long game. Losing a 4 hour game in the last minute just because of bad luck can be quite frustrating.  2016-03-08 It is remarkable how well Die Macher has stood the test of time. Considering the fact that the game was designed back in the mid 80\\'s, it is still very relevant. Of course, you have to admit that the game is not as visually pleasing as you would expect today. It almost looks like a prototype. After a while the table also starts to look very busy.  Once you get past the game\\'s age and looks, you have a solid but heavy strategy game in your hands. Each turn has many steps and is rather complex. There are a lot of things to keep an eye on. Fortunately, there is a fair amount of fluctuation of luck which helps in maintaining the flow of the game. If the Die Macher was purely deterministic, would it surely suffer from too much analysis. Now, since you cannot calculate everything, you can come up with sensible moves within a reasonable amount of time. Of course, very tight games can be decided by chance but usually it is the best player who wins.  Die Macher is definitely not the beast its reputation suggests. There are far heavier and more difficult games out there. Yes, the game is long but you do not need the whole day. A game can be finished in an evening. They aren\\'t kidding when they say all that stuff about Die Macher being long and complex. My head hurt for a couple of days after playing this. And we only made it through 4 rounds. Played Moskito 2nd Edition (the one with the best graphic design) today.  It\\'s a good game but I don\\'t see myself playing it too often. Also it has the ability of making me very disappointed with some results that happen due to chance. Ther\\'s only so much in this game you can control and that much isn\\'t much. Update: the revised version plays in half the time and is quite enjoyable. Still more of a logistics game than I like. But teach in 20, play in 3hrs is a pretty good place to be.   Original: I think it will end up a solid 6 or 7 for me. I felt that the landscape of the platforms/will of the people changed a bit to dramatically and the luck of the poll cards was just a bit too tough. I didn\\'t mind having to buy the poll card of a region you were competitive in RIGHT now, but it dampened the desire/ability to actively work later regions because then you\\'d have to buy those every time until they were resolved. I\\'m not generally opposed to a bit of luck, but this seemed a bit much for such a long and heavy game. That said, I enjoyed it considerably as an \\'experience\\' game. Very glad to have played. I was very, very interested in Die Macher. I love politics, I studied German politics a bit in college, and it was a heavier euro, which is generally my preferred type of game.   Unfortunately, I was terribly, terribly disappointed. The game itself was a bit of a slog. I don\\'t really mind long games (unless they start hitting the 9 hour mark) but the interlocking mechanisms seemed to be less interesting and thematic then they could have been. I am not normally a theme nazi, but I would prefer a bit of a stronger one on a game as long as this. In addition there seemed to be really no way to catch up once you were behind. Assuming competent play by the people on the lead, if you make a mistake in which elections to invest in during the beginning of the game you are going to be behind for the rest of the game. Our relative positions after the second election, were identical at the end of the game. In the end, I was rather disappoint with it. I would be willing to play it again, just to see if I can confirm my opinions, but on the whole? Thumbs down.  First Euro-German style game I was introduced to and played. [2, or really 1 1/2 plays] Finally got to play this, and it\\'s pretty cool, but way complicated.  Definitely had the problems with not thinking quite enough steps ahead, and planning stuff that turned out to be against the rules just because there were so many rule details I couldn\\'t remember them all.  I would need a few more plays of this just to start to play competently, but it might be worth doing.   If you\\'re into it, it\\'s a great game. I don\\'t feel involved with this one, though. An enigmatic game.Simply so many fiddly details and such a long time to play that it stands out and doesn\\'t get played much in our groups because it needs dedicated game enthusiasts to enjoy it with time on their hands.  Having said that it\\'s a lot of fun to play, in spite of the many abstractions and frankly lousy artwork (in the most recent edition) that makes it very difficult to distinguish policies.  I can\\'t quite understand it\\'s apparent popularity and high ranking here, but concur that it\\'s got enough character and random complexity to make for a jolly fun time when played with the right folk. We just laugh a lot at the very unjust blind auction of opinion poll results! A game of genius,if long and in some points luck determined. I sucked at it first play. Need to play again to get it - which  i\\'d like to do. The older version with 4 partys and players. Initial rating after one short version.  Good depth, strategic/tactical balance, and player interaction.  But the game is slow, and perhaps ponderous.  Feels like too many phases in each round multiplied by four (for each board).  Definitely engaging, but... fun? Too randomness for a so long game. It does not simulate a real electoral system and all parties have the same profile at the beginning. I\\'d say \"usually willing to play\" if it was shorter. --- Played again seven years later, I still found it extremely long for what it is. There is little chance of changing the own tendencies and, therefore, coalitions. One of the best theme ever. The game itself offers quite amount of decisions to make, allthough there is a huge luckfactor included as well. The biggest no-no is the game lenght which is way too much compared to what you get. But (most) because of it\\'s great theme Die Macher is a game which I\\'m ready to play every now and then. man i don\\'t want to remember this 1, it was a whole night playing this, but i think it deserves another shot 5 hours of tension and thinking ahead.  Can German politics be fun?  They sure as hell can be.  Die Macher is a classic and it deserves its status.  I\\'ve never seen such an intricate design that requires so much foresight.  It\\'s truly incredible how well the multiple layers intertwine.  I would LOVE to play this again.   From the Reviews: Looks like it could be fun with the right people but then again finding enough people to play a heavy long game might be difficult Just too long, and too much of what you need to do is pissing off your fellow players. + Interesting, complex, classic deep game. - The randomness brought by the cards can be frustrating. Very intricate.  Won my first game despite apparently trailing in third place throughout and playing semi-randomly at times.  3 player game clocked in at 2.5 hours.  Probably wouldn\\'t want to play with more people as that\\'s about my time limit. 3-5 | (5) | 240 min | 14+ | Karl-Heinz Schmiel Very well designed political simulation. Lots of options and room for, ahem, politicking. It does not get an \\'8\\' because the various icons are difficult to differentiate in the Valley Games edition. A tad long, but a rewarding experience in any case. Intelligent design and good components for a game that seems to me a bit dry and too long. 0-1 2013-02-04  Initial Rating: 7.0  (February 2013)  It’s been years since I heard about this game. I have always heard it was a great game so expectation was high.  I finally played it last week and the verdict is positive. Die Macher is a good deep game, however my (only) game was a little slow because no one had a clear understanding of the rules, thus we made some procedural mistakes and only took 6 turns. I think I like the game but I need to play it again to properly rate and comment. It seems the rules are complex, but once you begin to play, you find the game flows and all works perfectly. Then you find that the rules are not that complex, but the gameplay is making Die Macher a very engaging and interesting game. However, this is not a game for beginners (steep learning curve).  At first, I thought it was a very boring game, now I really would like to play it again soon. (But the theme IS very boring for me). I´m amazed that the game came out in 1986 (I was 4 at the time) still has the potential to beat most modern games. The components are adequate, but nothing that surprises you.  The game took a long time, but I didn’t feel it, all the players were engaged all the time and that is the mark of a great game. It also has negotiating and lots and lots of tough decisions. The key is to stay flexible :D.  On the bad side, there is the long play time (not a problem for me personally, but this makes hard to play the game more often). Also it has more luck than I initially expected from a game this heavy. There is a decent amount of luck on the dice, but what really shocked me was the regional polls. All your carefully laid plans can be utterly destroyed by them and they seem out of place in the, otherwise, strategy rich game.  For now this is a tentative rating, I want to play it again soon to review my comments, but I think it has the potential to go higher in my ratings.  Current Rating: 7.0 [hr] 2018-01-18  It’s been years since I last played Die Macher and my desire to do has been steadily decreasing over time. I’m sure I will play it again and when I do so I will come back to comment again. For now, I´m downgrading its rating.  Current Rating: 6.0 I enjoyed my fist game but found it too random sometimes. Long and repetitive. Die Macher is a game about elections in Germany played over 7 rounds where each player represents a political party.  At the end of each round, one of 7 regions is scored with players receiving VPs and money based on how many seats they\\'ve received in that region.  At the end of the game, players receive additional VPs based on party membership and how well they match the national opinions.    The crux of the game are the 7 political issues.  Each player\\'s tableau has 6 cards that show the players in favor or opposed to 6 of the 7 issues.  Each region has a table of 4 cards showing it in favor or opposed to 4 of the 7 issues and the national stage has a tableau of 5 cards showing it in favor or opposed to 5 of the 7 issues.  While players start with their 6-card tableau face up, the other tableaus are built/revealed over time.  There are several mechanics for changing the cards in the tableau but in general, they change slowly.  When a region scores, players score money and VPs based on their party meeting investment multiplied by the net # of issues they match plus a player-specific, region-specific modifier.  While all players get money and VPs, the winner also gets additional VPs and gets to place 1 or 2 cards in the national tableau (potentially swapping out cards already there).    The game, published in 1986, is a classic with a lot of moving parts, multiple types of auctions, and benefits and costs for going early/late in turn order.  The game takes a while to explain (30+ minutes) and a long time to play (our first play was 7+ hours although rumor has it that it should take around 4 - 5 hours).    There is a fair bit of randomness.  Players are only able to change their tableau based on cards they draw.  If they don\\'t draw cards that match the popular issues, they can\\'t take those positions.  In addition, adjustments to party membership are done with die rolls and rolling well or poorly can have a significant impact. Next, there are incremental auctions for opinion polls (one per region) each round.  The opinion polls let people adjust two player-specific, region-specific modifiers or their own party membership.  The cards are face-down when bid for and may or may not help the player who won them.   With all that said, the randomness is mostly manageable and is well within most player\\'s comfort even for a game of 4+ hours.    Very unusual for a game this old, there is very little downtime.  By breaking a round down into lots of phases and players involved in each phase, players are constantly involved.  There is also a lot of opportunity for clever play.  Player can make promises and form coalititions but promises are not binding and even players in coalitions can screw each other.    Despite the level of randomness, I really enjoyed my first play and am anxious to get to play it again.  After one play, provisional rating is an 8 with movement of up or down 1 very possible. The game is probably an 8 for quality.  It has some interesting mechanics, but the length makes it difficult to play.  Also, the public opinion polls seem to have a big influence.  Finally, even with good strategy, players can get shut out of policies with unlucky draws. Immense game, the type you play only once a year. The design is quite unique and fun if people play cutthroat, especially on the biddings. Not quite sure we played with the right rules though.  The implementation is quite bad though (VG version). Horrible graphic design and terribly dull rulebook limits the accessibility of the game. I feel like a large part of the weight of the game is simply due to the poor implementation. There should be an easier way to keep track of multiplier/influence. Poor bookkeeping just lengthen the thinking time unnecessarily. This is one of the Boyfriends grail games.  Enjoyed the play of this and it is really quite different to anything else in my collection. It\\'s not as amazing as the current price tag would seem to suggest but it is quite good.  We only played the short game (5turns) but still played for a good 5 or so hours, but it was a learning game for all of us. None of us were really thinking about strategy rather just doing stuff and seeing what effect it would actually have.  Overall I would be happy to play again. A tough game to teach and play for the first game.  Lots of cross-cutting, interesting mechanics that seem to be nicely thematic.  The card iconography is terrible, and the game play a little bit clunky and time consuming, but overall, I definitely want to play the game again to better understand its subtleties. 8 of 10. (October 2012)  Okay, played Die Macher for a second time, the new edition, in February 2020, and for my tastes in game design, I think there are just too many things about this game that feel randomly decisive.  For example, the polling mechanic, and the platform card array with its \"luck of the draw\" flips, and the blind bidding for turn order.  In general, I really dislike games where blind bidding plays an overly decisive role in the game, and Die Macher seems to feature this problem.  Bottom line: unfortunately, this game now feels like an \"old school\" euro design, wherein random events are actually considered a fun feature of the design.  Not a fan.  Dropping it to a 6 of 10.   Won with strong scores in nearly all categories. My party platform matched the national board well most of the game, and I won 2 elections (in coalitions with me as the stronger partner). You can get points by getting votes even without winning. Winning in a coalition is nearly as good as winning alone. Going last in turn order helped. Would be higher but due to game length it may never see the light of day again.  Played once and really enjoyed it but was an epic 4 hour constant brainburner. Reminds me of El grande, In that It\\'s a game that encourages extreme AP, but still has swings of luck that can make the best decisions meaningless.  I can see why this was a great game in 86, but for the time and player count required there are so many better options around today.  Edit: Probably need to give this another go, my first playthrough was hamstrung by deciding to stop competing when It was clear I wasn\\'t going to win the first election, not realising it was still worth going all out for seats as it was the 80 seat state, which put me well being the curve and soured the rest of my game. For such a brain burning game, with lots to analyze, I find the importance of luck and especially winning last round a bit too great. It also feels a bit too chaotic and very poor choice of icons makes assessing the situation needlessly difficult. An  interesting experience, but one I don\\'t feel the need to repeat. Only one play. I felt in control during the first half and out of control during the second, which dampened my enthusiasm. The mechanisms fit together quite nicely and I do enjoy them, but the whole affair feels a little long to me. I wonder if I might enjoy 5 elections more than 7. This game has some major component flaws in regards to the 2019 version by Stronghold and Spielworx.  They didn’t include enough poll cards and the paper money is far far worse then Monopoly money. Rating penalized at least a point for these flaws alone. Add to that the cost of 70$ for a game with such sub par components it makes a game with great play factors impossible to recommend. I finally played a grail game. I\\'ve wanted to play this game since I first logged on to the Geek back in 2002. It wasn\\'t everything I hoped it would be. Maybe because of just one play, maybe because it was just long, maybe because it felt so chaotic and uncontrollable to me. Either way, I\\'d play it again, but won\\'t buy it or seek it out to play specifically. Played once with Jean-François Wüstefeld, and purchased his copy as a souvenir when he died. Nice game, but long and intricate.  Needs repeated plays for the rating to go up. One of my biggest gaming disappointments of all time. Based on all the hype, I had great expectations. Too much Euro and not enough politics and diplomacy. I felt like pushing cubes around a board, not making deals and reacting politically. Politics should feel like politics, not a math puzzle. Lots of moving parts, quite long, interesting at first but dragging on for much too long without becoming varied enough to be still compelling. As far as mechanics go, however, it still holds its charm. Not sure I\\'d play this one again since it is long and procedural. It features a style of play in eurogames that has gone a bit out of vogue -- similar to El Grande, Cyclades, etc. Whereas newer euros (Feld-style) tend to be indirect conflict -- over turn order, or limited/singular resources -- these first gen euros have more overt conflicts, that involve tampering with your opponents\\' deployments. I\\'m not a great sport with these -- I tend not to try my hardest if it\\'s clear I\\'m not going to win, and instead I start targeting players I don\\'t like, causing mutually assured destruction. It\\'s a style of game that doesn\\'t bring out the best in me. In the multi-player solitaire style euros, there are more compelling puzzles to go for as secondary (or primary) goals, above and beyond the W. For example, optimizing your initial set of cards in Agricola, figuring out how to clear your tableaux in Macao,  trying to fulfill your tasks in Bora Bora. Plus there\\'s just less of an impact in disrupting others\\' plans; you don\\'t get a lot of misery for your troubles. But with games like Die Macher and El Grande, you can pretty much insure that your target will not win by waging a campaign that goes against their interests, without regard to your own. 7 rounds is slightly too many. I\\'d really seen everything after 5 and would have been happy to end the game there. It also (the 2 extra rounds) made no difference to our final scores. All that happened was, but that time, people\\'s attention was wandering.  Beyond that, I like a lot about the game; the original selection of issues seemed fairly key as did the luck of the draw in getting suitable replacement issues. Deep, political, chaotic. It shows its age with things that modern games no longer require such as a preliminary round that demands decisions before you know all of the concepts and 10+ phases per round. The table talk made this game interesting but six hours was quite a commitment. It will be a struggle to get this one played outside a convention where players can dedicate most of a day to it. Overall this is a decent game of political party management/electioneering.  I thought everything worked together pretty well.  The theme, however, is really dry.  One thing that I noticed is that I could make a 180 on my party platform, but that had no impact on my party members, when in real life it probably would.  You also have to realize that you need to be playing one or two rounds ahead to make sure you keep party cards that will benefit you, or take a slight hit this round to set yourself up for the next.  The dice are the biggest part of luck here.  Drawing poor party cards doesn\\'t bother me that much, and doing an auction of a blind poll before it comes out is thematic, even if you wind up spending a bunch of money on something that doesn\\'t help you that much.  I\\'m glad I at least played this once, and while I would play it again, I don\\'t feel a need to request it. Not as heavy as some say. Just a lot of fiddly stuff. The concept is interesting and the strategy of planning for now or for the future is cool but there are too many silly things for a game this long, most notably the poll auctions.  It is a fine game but feels its age.  The rinse and repeat makes me a little bored, and the Valley Games edition is fugly. (they may all be fugly) 這遊戲對我真是個夢靨，4~5小時的遊戲時間，運氣卻佔很重，結果我從頭被卡到尾，只贏了最後一場選舉...不會想再玩了QQ Played once. A good game, but showing its age. The mechanisms are well-thought out, thematic and nicely interlocking, but there really is too much randomness for a game of this length. Enjoyable game. Highly interactive, with a lot of moving parts, but without feeling complex for the sake of it, and without feeling conflict heavy.  Not very thematic, though. Recently I played the streamlined version. Unfortunately this \"streamlining\" is just a cutting off negotiating as a core of the game. Now it feels very mechanic and the theme is vanishing in the background. If you have the 1986 version, you definitely don\\'t need the reprint. I had many hopes for the reprint but they were disappointed :( Would be great if playtime wasn\\'t so long. I find the new version of Die Macher more enjoyable than the original.  I like how well the dry theme integrates itself into the game.  Every turn you try to change/adapt your party\\'s policies.  The randomness of the party program cards and the polling results can be frustrating. 7箇所で影響力争いをする選挙ゲーム。影響力の計算が、送り込んだ駒×(影響レベル+自分の場にあるカードと選挙区のカードの一致)という立体的な構造になっていて、駒数で競うエリアマジョリティに一捻り加えたものになっている。ただ煩雑な処理や野暮ったい要素もあり、古さは否めないものの、面白い。ラウンドごとに一つずつ選挙区の決算を行っていくんだけども、自分のカードは1枚しか変えられず、選挙区のカードに合わせようすると先を見越した計画が必要だったり、影響レベルを動かすには競りをする必要があり金が必要で、と様々な要素がぐちゃっとしてて濃い 1 Play  Might have been a better game if it had been tighter and shorter. Despite enjoying my first play through on the game, I cannot somehow bring myself to play this again. -1 in the ratings as a consequence.  7/9/19 - Moving this back to a 7. Can be really interesting with a proper implementation. 3/15/20 - Is alright. Not great. Ein wenig unausgeglichen bzgl. der letzten Runde/Bundesland und deren Auswirkung auf die Endwertung. 1 play / 4 players  LIKE: I liked how players could build up votes in another area while attempting to conduct manipulation in another. This created some interesting aspects in timing, and when to spend money. The rules for the short game were not too complicated. The theme is unique.  DISLIKE: The cards created a very luck-oriented feel to the game. I think not allowing a card flush would help with this. There are also some random take-that cards in the poll deck, which felt out of place. I feel some other mechanism could have been used.  OVERALL: Not a bad game, but the random elements made the game results seem lopsided. For that much of a time investment, we might be better playing something else. I saw a variant in the BGG forums for mixing in first edition rules, may be worth a look.  Some similarities to El Grande, but El Grande is so much better. 一个非常看运气的游戏，起始手牌不好的话建议直接掀桌！玩一局要三至四个小时，第二把我们玩的时候有三家手牌高度一致，结果就变成二打三，无论如何都没办法翻盘，简直浪费时间！ very excited to try out my new version. Good game.  Easy to play.  Really too long for what it is and if you get back luck in the beginning there is never really a way to catch up and luck at the end also swings the game to much for my taste since there is really only one way to gather significant points to stay in the game. 5 To casual to be good This is really random. [ESP] El juego tiene mecánicas muy bien pensadas y que funcionan bien. Sin embargo dura demasiaaaaaaado: 4 horas con 4 jugadores. Y todo el tiempo preguntando: ¿que viene ahora? A mi parecer es preferible invertir ese tiempo en 2 o 3 juegos que entretengan más... If you have many many hours to kill here\\'s your game.  Good game, but too complex and too long. Rarely hits the table. both original Moskito and Moskito/HiG-version This is daunting to teach to new players, and we only ever have time for the short game. But even with only 3 players the game is very strategic and very fulfilling. The game reminds me of Tigris and Euphrates, in that I am often at a loss for which of my many strategic options to make use of. This makes the game very deep, but also a little too complex and frustrating at times. Do not care to play again. Played once and avoid it ever since. Need to give it another go I guess. I need to play this again to verify my current ranking.  My ranking just seems off - especially when considering what I like in games and what this game is...  I would venture to guess this rating is based off the group that I played with, which made the play a poor experience.  I expect my rating to move upward, but getting this to the table is a feat in itself.   Balanced & simulating, but too long, very luck based and who really wants to play German parliament elections? Just too complex to be worth figuring out and then teaching to my game group. If I were immortal, this game would no doubt rate higher. As it is, I am often reluctant to invest four or more hours into a game, even one as good as Die Macher. The mechanics is a little bit outdated. Well designed for its age, but too long, and several things didn\\'t quite click for me.  Remarkably balanced, remarkably challenging, and remarkably deep, this game is perfect for me, as most of the decisions to be made focus on the currently available region.  While there is some planning, the game is primarily reactionary, and I do better at these sorts of games.  The only thing working against it is its length of play.  1 play: 5 players Good if a bit fiddly at times. If it were just a bit shorter... Too complicate for me. Very elegant and unique, however this game is the very definition of boredom. Took us 7.5 hours to finish our first game, and I couldnt wait for it to end. The only other game that has bored me so much was Power Grid, the only thing saving this game from a lower rating is it\\'s unique mechanics that seem to tie in very well with the very thin theme that it has. Too long for the likes of me! I need to play again to know for sure, but I think this game might have actually out-Euroed me.  It\\'s a very complicated game with lots of counting.  I hate games with lots of counting.  I don\\'t like it when I can make better decisions if I spend five minutes counting everything before my turn - I\\'d rather play by feel and just get on with it.  Can\\'t really do that in this game.  I should play again, but whenever the opportunity arises I just don\\'t want to. Rating should go up with more plays. Esperando que llegue de Alemania (17 abril).Llegó sin problemas tras 10 días de travesía; he leído las reglas y se ve muy entretenido. Creo que deberé estudiarlo al menos unas 5-6 veces, más la traducción de las cartas y términos alemanes, antes de ponerlo en la mesa.8,8 puntuación dada por mis Geekbuddies. Jugado en junio un par de veces: muy pesado para mi grupo, que se desconcentra mucho. Lamentable decisión de venta :-( Lots of interesting things going on in this game, but it\\'s just too long (5-6 hours in our group) and too random (opinion cards in your initial deal and in the regions, opinion polls that you\\'re bidding for blindly, and enough die rolling to hurt if you roll badly but not enough to average out the luck), with way too much \"take that\" along the way (opinion polls and shadow cabinets).  And since it\\'s so hard to evaluate all the wealth of information, you may be mistakenly thought of as leading, and whacked with negative opinion polls, letting the real leader stay on top.  So it\\'s more about whining and diplomacy than anything else.  I\\'d like to try it once with the opinion polls face-up, so you can see what you\\'re bidding for, but I have a feeling it won\\'t help enough for me to really enjoy it.  Tyranno Ex (same designer) has many similar mechanisms (despite the completely different theme!), is an hour or two shorter, and has a more up-front luck factor (and fits the theme better) that doesn\\'t bother me nearly as much. Pretty good game.  I probably haven\\'t played this one enough to truly rate it, but I was a bit let down as it\\'s supposed to be one of the greats. I am SO not the maker. I might be willing to go again, but the sinking feeling of doing poorly is pretty rough over such a long game. Were I to play again, I\\'d avoid (I hope) a couple of mechanical errors that hurt and would pay more attention to coalition building and turn order (not to mention winning elections). There\\'s a lot going on here, and it\\'s really kind of cool, so my rating\\'s based more on my personal inclination to play. This game has many fun and interesting play mechanisms.  Unfortunately, the luck and chaos factors that I would otherwise find tolerable become a deal breaker in a game of this length. I could easily play two or more games of RRT (or any other substantial game) in the same time period.  My curiosity is satisfied, and I\\'ll not be playing this again. We haven\\'t got to play this one yet. I am looking forward to it. Tons going on here. There is some nasty play involved, and its long, but I think that\\'s the point, and it pretty well fits the theme. This may rise with more play.  Valley games. Opened but unplayed and unpunched. Well I finally have played this and I denounce those people that call the the best EURO game.  It extremely luck driven given it\\'s 5 hour play time. The op polls are ridiculously powerful. It\\'s possible to be dealt an impossible position from the very start.  It is very fiddly.  I love the heaviest of heavy games and am not afraid of a good game, but this is not one of them. I\\'d play only occassionally but certanly would not rate this very high. My biggest disappointment in some time, perhaps because my expectations were so high. The first couple turns provided everything friends had recommended Die Macher for: a deep game with lots of strategic options and many apparent paths to victory.   However, in the mid- to late-game money flows freely, and the options degenerate to throwing the max the game allows at the media, meetings, and shadow cabinets, etc., then dumping every dollar you have left on random polls that may not help you, but - because your other options for mitigating the damage are restricted by seemingly arbitrary limits - 20% of the time the polls are too catastrophic not to spend every dollar available to keep them away from your opponents. I like games that involve tactical choices to mitigate potential bad luck, but if there isn\\'t a runaway leader, Die Macher is decided largely by the random draw of the last three poll cards - *far* too much weight on a small number of random events for my taste - /especially/ in a 4 hour game. It\\'s not like we can play several times to let variations in luck average out.  If I play again, I\\'ll insist on a shorter game (I believe five elections is one of the official options) and probably on some house rules to lower the amount of cash available. (In my first game few players took the special interest money more than once or twice, yet we were all drowning in cash, spending >100K on face-down cards that 80% of the time ended up being merely 0-3 points.) Without the cash to max out everything except the auctions I think the game would be more interesting, but the overwhelming power of those random polls may still ruin it.   I\\'m told different editions have significantly different rules for determining the availability of the public opinion options media influence can choose. The rules we used made the media too powerful - especially in the late game - and made it foolish not to spend every available dollar (up to the arbitrary cap) on media markers. One player wandering by at the convention suggested that the rule of always having six public opinion options available for the media would be more balanced. I don\\'t know which edition that rule is from, or if it\\'s a house rule, but I agree.  I can appreciate that Die Macher is one of the games that \"founded\" the Eurogaming hobby, but ignoring the rose-colored glasses of nostalgia, there are SO many other games I\\'d rather play. There are some interesting things going on in this game (the ability to plan ahead in future elections, for instance), but there is an awful lot of card-based luck in terms of candidate platforms, polls/trends, and card-related scoring.  Also, if you do very poorly in the first election (which is a money election), you\\'re already at a fairly decent disadvantage.  I may play this again, but I may not. Not a bad game. Finicky and mechanical. For a long game with planning, too much random luck is thrown in, particularly the blind poll cards that are bidded on. Not a game that I would describe as \\'fun\\'. Will need a replay to decide. Really long.  And I like long games. Played once as a 5-player game after extensive study of rulebook.  We played the Valley Games\\' 5 Round variant.  This session still took 4 total hours for rules explanation and playing time.    My first impressions were sort of lackluster.  I definitely see the good in Die Macher, but there is a lot of luck thrown in for a 4-hour game!  Dice rolls for party membership can result in huge swings in collected income and endgame points.  I also am not a big fan of Coalitions for if you are the odd man out due to sheer luck of the party Platform draw, you lose.  The production quality is horrible.  The symbols on the cards are difficult to see from across the table.  I \"fixed\" this problem by using stickers.   An overly long game where you seem to do the same thing 7 times and the final result is determined largely by whether you hold the same cards as other people and/or the people in each election.  If you\\'re out of synch with other players, then you\\'ll never get as many votes/points as they will.  A playing time of 2  hours just isn\\'t worth the effort - just roll 2 dice and if you get 10  then you win the game (no need to involve other players and a combined saving of 10  hours). Four of us played the longer 5 hour version.  Not sure what the hype is about.  Too long a game for such repetition.  So many calculations that it is difficult to really know how you are doing unless obviously way behind.  I failed to get enough money in the first round and was behind for the remainder of the game.  I was always outbid which simply produced more money for those who won the bid. 5 hours is a long time to play and win only one bid.     What was Valley Games thinking when they made the graphics on the Public Opinion and Party Platform cards so similar for Global Terrorism, Nuclear Power, and Economic Redevelopment?  All of us were picking up the Public Opinion cards to get a better look to see which of the three policies it was--how irritating.        I am sure I will have to suffer through this again, but all of us agree that it will be the shorter version. Finally I play the holy grail of heavy Euro games and as often seems inevitable, it is disappointing.  I hesitate to lump this in with Euro games, after all it arrived in the 80s, long before the Germans started pumping games out in bulk, it is far longer and more complicated than any Euro before or since and because it is themed extremely well.    I think the high praise on BGG stems from what I dub Final Fantasy 7 syndrome.  For many people who entered the hobby through lighter Euro games, this is the first experience with a heavy game outside of the normally scorned wargame and it will no doubt impress a jaded gamer tired of the many rehashed mechanics dumped on the market.  However, rather than gaining, as I hoped it would, from its dual citizenship in the German and American gaming heritage, it suffers from it.  We have a long and complicated game that is just as restricting and just as familiar as most Euros.  How can a game about politics actually have so little politicking?  The game has all the trappings of a great politically themed game, but it in fact missed the most interesting and vital parts.  I still haven\\'t come to terms with how a coalition is more a means to piggyback on another\\'s success than parties with a similar platform cooperating to thwart their more divergent political adversaries.  When actually playing the theme loses importance as you grow bored with the complete lack of narrative.  Very little actually builds up as you play the game, so all 6 rounds are very similar.  Which just doesn\\'t cut it for a three hour game.  For that time length I want something more lasting and memorable, not your average Euro stretched out longer.  Because that is what Die Macher really is, your average Euro trying to extend beyond its humble origins and failing. Played once.  This game is so over-rated, it\\'s sad.  This was simply NOT fun.  Our game was won by the most apathetic player in the game, who understood the rules the least, and was least excited about playing: me.  I have no real interest in playing again.  I suppose I can see why some people might like it; those people who like games in which the first half is almost irrelevant, and the last half is a race between about half of the players.  Yay... I am not opposed to heavy games but this crosses my threshold I very much enjoy the depth and decision making durring the game.  The way various aspects interact and need to be balanced is alot of fun.  Unfortunatily it is also very much influenced by luck.  The last election holds much more weight because of this and at times it can feel like the game would have been much improved by simply removing the first 6 of the seven elections entirely. Heavy, counter intuitive and fiddly. Highly disappointed with first game. May need more plays to decide, won\\'t suffer it. Fascinating game of epic scope. I feel that the design could be modernized with respect to reducing the luck and the length. The playing time is a major minus for this game although it is well liked by my group of players. I really wanted to like this one ( I guess at that time the game mechanisms were truly innovative) but the survey cards can just ruin all planning effort, which is really frustrating. Too technical and too dry for me.  As a german citizen I must say that the game fails in its attempt to catch the spirit of how elections in Germany work.  Sold my copy. One of my Wife\\'s favorites but it\\'s not one of mine.  I find it a bit dull and will only play if they need me for a 5th or they offer me cash. I was excited to play this game. However, the pace of the game was too slow for my interest to really be grabbed. Once the game started, I felt actions were too sporadically spaced. The game is a bit longer than it needs to be. Glad to have finally gotten a play in of this. It did take 4 hours or so. It is fun and lots of interesting choices. You could probably do 4 elections instead of 7 and cut 1.5 hours out of gameplay without seriously hurting your enjoyment of it. It may have even had a short-game option which I think i would take next time.  It was complex enough that we were consulting the player aids on every turn. More interesting in concept than in play.   The polls are far to important to outcomes for the amount of variance that they introduce to the game. Also I think the game could probably be shortened without much loss to strategic play. The game is too long for what it does.  The game would benefit greatly if the money were more limiting. I find the polls to be too powerful and random for the length of the game.  Everyone knows they\\'re powerful, so you can\\'t win them all.  Your ability to swap issues can be too restrictive as well.  The interesting part of the game is how the players interact and both of these issues just detract from the core of the game.   Too long and fiddly. Cards are very difficult to set apart from each other (Valley Games version). Some trivial decicions take a long time to calculate.   Some interesting decisions and thematical for an euro. If this was a 2 hour game I could like it, but 3+ hours is too much. I was bored.  Unfortunately, in Die Macher, that means I was bored for 4 hours. adjust politics of your party or the opinion of the people to win german elections. some weaknesses, but an interesting, slightly too long, game. Very good game of forward planning. It doesn\\'t show the age. My rating would be higher if it wasn\\'t so long. I actually had this as a 10 until I played the Valley games version of it.  The botched graphics and a few \"modified\" rules ruined a playing for me and I really don\\'t care to try it again. A good game. Tons going on. Not really my thing but very impressive, especially for 1986. Very good election simulation, but oh so long with oh so many rules. I hope I never play again. I can see the game being a great design of its time, but in the year of 2014 it is way outdated. It reminds me a lot of Dominant Species, but DS is a much better game. Solid euro mechanics, but the game takes far too long to play. Long. There appears to be a significant amount of player-interaction-created randomness as well as randomness introduced by the issue cards.  I\\'m sure that an experienced player would learn to control some of the randomness, but there\\'s still a significant negotiation / predicting-other-player\\'s-intentions element. gespendet an bodo In our two 5 player sessions, the player who was at the last (or second to last) positon the most won. Maybe there\\'s more to it, but 10 hours with the game was enough.  Extremely heavy game and too mathy for me.  I also find the eye-gouging in this game to be too extreme and very unfair.  You can spend four turns and multiple actions building up your position in one zone only to have all that hard work completely undone with a single action from another player that is impossible for you to stop, and this happens time after time throughout the game.  Plays far too long also. Die Macher as a game that is over 30 years old and still played is an example of another time in gaming. Today, the game lacks a certain pizzazz that newer heavy euros have (not just in theme, but mechanical implementation) and it\\'s more difficult to hold the attention of players. I can see where those who put in the effort to look past the points where modern gamers would say \"this really should be streamlined\" and study of the design will be rewarded.  In some ways, it\\'s a game that falls into the same category as Virgin Queen/HiS and the COIN series; long, hulking, beautiful monstrosities that require a full player count to shine. Bonus points if they are all experienced folks. People have to rearrange their lives and schedules to make these sorts of games happen. Die Macher is a wonderful convention game, provided people have agree on a rule set... Unfortunately, that boat seems to have sailed, and the 4th edition is also unlikely to resolve that. That\\'s not necessarily bad, just an annoyance.  This is an experience, one of those games that was revolutionary at it\\'s time, and I encourage people to give it a shot. I\\'d like to sit and tinker with it, to explore how the interlocking pieces and parts all fit together, but at what cost? Do I need a copy on hand? I doubt it, possibly just nearby. Every now and then I think about it, even if it took years to get it to the table, and I\\'m unsure when I\\'ll see it played again...  edit: The more I fiddle with and talk about the game with others, the more I find that it\\'s just undercooked, and you have to cobble together an agreeable ruleset in order to get it to really sing. I don\\'t think that\\'s worth my time anymore. Too long and some systems too random. Prior to 2020: 1 play The game is interesting. If playable in half the time, it would have been a 7 Not for me This is a fun two or three hour game. Unfortunately, it\\'s a five or six hour game. Also, the theme is a little dry. Glad I played it.  Don\\'t really feel the need to play again.  Just too long for what it is. Yay, I finally got to play the board game that is number 1 in the BGG database! I played the newest version, which has some updated rules, but most of the game is the same. We were 4 players, which I know is not ideal according to BGG, where 5 players are preferred, but I actually think 4 worked quite well and did cut the playing time down; and even so the game still took 3-4 hours... And this is my main criticism for me personally as I rarely like extremely long games, so while I know that the game is objectively good, I don\\'t really want to play it again... Although I have promised to play it once more with 5 players to get the full experience. Is it me? One of the few games that I really don&#039;t want to play ever again. This is a very interesting game, but it just doesn\\'t grab me enough for the long playing time. This simply takes to long to play without offering a lot of variety. Although I am very interested in politics, I touch this only every other year. I don\\'t get the excitement. [Played once] While interesting conceptually, it is quite long (and not varied enough to soften the lenght) and random at times (a game based on long term planning that can be affected so much by chance isn\\'t good for me). There are also some \"take that!\" elements introducing a diplomatic aspect (maybe fitting the theme, but prolonging the game and creating a \"metagame\" of whining and negotiations). Too many games with a better ratio between \"fun & engagement\" and \"energy & time spent\" have become available in the last ten years. Surpassed. Did not age well for me. Long, fiddly and (dare I say) boring. Tough call this. As I know it will be blasphemous for some eyes to read, but I just couldn\\'t understand why the world is in love with this game.  It is repetative, heavy on screwage, and heavily luck driven.  I know a lot of people will argue that luck levels itself out.  But two people experienced (at seperate times) four rounds of being unable to set up their platforms to work with the current or future opinions because of poor card draws.  Also money seems useless, except for bidding up the trend card.  Which in it\\'s own right is totally luck based.  I would say 90% of the time someone spent a small fortune for nothing - 3 national party points. the length of the game, and commitment to play makes the luck in this too devastating. Keep in mind this is said from someone that likes both luck and scewage in games. Not sorry I got rid of it - there\\'s a lot to like here, but I don\\'t like most of it. I feel like it is too difficult to figure out how your decisions will affect your standing in the game.  That coupled with the long playing time make it difficult for me to recommend this game to anyone besides a serious gamer.  I\\'ll give this another shot, but it really seemed like I took something that wasn\\'t fun the first time I did it and just kept doing it over and over. Oh yay, a 4-5 hour game about German politics with cumbersome mechanics. No thanks. Cooler in concept than play.  Too fiddley for the payoff for me--I\\'d rather just play a detailed wargame if I wanted the complexity or a short Euro if I wanted different strategies to win.  Disappointed by the hype. To be fair, I haven\\'t even finished a game. It took us almost two hours to get through the first of the seven elections and then we finally sort of knew what was going on. It isn\\'t that it is a bad game, it just is very long. There isn\\'t anything here that can\\'t be found in some other Eurogame with a better theme, prettier pieces, and a fourth of the time. Overrated. Pretty tedious and dry, but a neat enough design to take for a spin once in a while. 07/31/05 Played one five-player game. Interesting. Yet I was in a fog most of the time. No desire to ever play again.  Thought I\\'d like this more than I did :( Very long and it needs the players all to understand the game for it to work - randomly doing stuff isn\\'t going to work in this game, you need to look at the current state and the future boards and plan your very limited actions carefully. Major thing I disliked was the exchange pool - being fixed at 6 cards and it is pretty static, if you have a hand of cards that doesn\\'t really fit with the rest of the game there isn\\'t much you can do if all you have in the pool are similar :( Wouldn\\'t be a problem if the game was (much) shorter. I hesitate to give this game a low rating as I can see why people enjoy it, but this game just isn\\'t for me.  It feels like it wants you to put a lot of thought into your strategy but the high randomness of all the cards and die rolls makes it too frustrating to plan ahead much.  Also, have to say the art on the Valley Games reprint is atrocious.  The topic cards are not only hard to distinguish from a distance but the icons on the bottom aren\\'t even consistent.  A reprint would go a long ways to making this more playable. Tried this monster twice. I can see why it was so popular at the time because of its varied complexity and ways of scoring points. however, for the time investment its a drag. Couldn\\'t wait to get rid of my copy. If the cards screw you, you\\'re in for a loooong, helpless experience. Initial platforms are determined randomly and you can only change these issues one at a time and only if you draw the cards that let you.  Thus, if your platform is nearly opposite of everyone else\\'s and you don\\'t draw cards to change them, 1) you\\'ll be fighting 4 other people to align any given state\\'s issues to your own, 2) you won\\'t be able to form a coalition with anyone.  As in real politics, you need to be able to drop out of the race so that it doesn\\'t affect anyone else.  Kingmakery at many stages of the game.  The rich get richer. The momentum gets momentumer. ;D  The states\\' random appearance helps variety but also makes for more chance of a random winner. If you are conservative with your resources, your push for an 80 state in the 6th or 7th round will be huge. Or you might look like a huge idiot. Realistic indeed but not fun.  Plusses?  Absorbing gameplay. The rules, although an initial overload, are theme integrated and logicially formatted--quite elegant.  Overall:  Unacceptable luck to game length ratio. I love the ideas in this one, and I thank it for spurring ideas in the game industry; but Die Macher really shows its age. Not convinced by this one. The entire game hinges solely on the opinion polls. Coalitions seem a bit random, and cash is never a problem after turn 3, so you aren\\'t making any decisions. Sadly disappointed after a week long build up... With the right crowd this game is a 10. Of course it is also kind of a lumbering procedural dated slog. I really have no idea how to rate this. It has been so long since my last play. I wonder if I were to play this now if I\\'d be immersed in all its chrome or drowned by it.  WIFE RATING - 5 Die Macher never struck me as a title I should be pursuing, and with the experience of a 2-round session (mutilating the long-term planning) by two players (eviscarating the coalition aspect) I really have no right to be judging this game, let alone discuss it the way I am doing now.   The game left a lasting impression of being needlessly complex on me. It derives a semblance of depth from the fact that it is nearly impossible to predict what will be happening a few turns from the current one, let alone how you should plan for the occasion. If the various ways in which cards are used, re-used, re-branded, shifted, and media\\'d away between various positions on different boards isn\\'t sufficient to convince you of that, then the fact that the score reaches large triple digit numbers, made up from six or seven distinct sources which more or less weigh in equally heavy in the total, surely will. There is no way to accurately guesstimate the effect of winning an election now versus holding out on one four turns later. Die Macher is therefore very close to its subject matter: politics [i]is[/i] a weird mixture of intuition, timing, and sometimes even knowledge.  Now it isn\\'t really fair to be comparing a game from 1986 to the standards of 2009, the time I played it. Games were very different back then: those were the days of Avalon Hill and wargames, so players were used to longer playing times and more detailed representations of a chosen subject. But still, that was 1986. Basically, I feel people should not go out of their way to try this mastodont. Chances are fairly large that if your interests run towards longer and more involved titles you\\'ll already have played it, and if they don\\'t then you lose little by passing over it. Don\\'t be fooled by the lure of \\'elegant\\' or \\'clean\\' mechanisms: they aren\\'t. Well, individually, they are. But there are [i]so many[/i] the effect is rather lost. If you like playing by gut feeling, and can stomach a good bit of cajoling, luring and dealmaking, and don\\'t mind the long playing time, perhaps it\\'s good fare. If you don\\'t, search out modern titles. For me, the single trial run was more than enough to know that I won\\'t be needing to try this game again.  [b]Update[/b] Looking back at my own comment I\\'m going to have to retract some of it. The future planning is still annoying in a game of this length, but it\\'s less bad than in my recollection. You can, through careful manipulation of the game\\'s mechanisms, alter the public opinion of future states in your own favour; but the question is then whether you have enough steam left to protect yourself against the inevitable backlash from opponents who alter your popularity to something which sucks harder than a black hole. Prematurely cashing in on meeting markers is key here, which is a mechanism which I obviously couldn\\'t have tested in full in my first attempt.  Coalitions are nice, but hard to play for, and even harder to abuse by timely manipulation of media markers. I struck a lucky coincidence in which I could force a coalition on a strong partner [i]after[/i] replacing her only media marker in the state with one of my own... and since the marker area was full at that point she couldn\\'t retaliate. This is in all likelihood advanced Macher-trickery.  That all said, the amount of randomness in this game is inexcusable for the length it takes to play. The party cards change only slowly; and the public opinion is chosen with little regard to sense or common values of the federal union. Yes, the game is about manipulating both, but it achieves this through contrived detours. And a player who is lucky to have a good overlap straight from the start will have his hands free to manipulate matters elsewhere. Opinion polls are a big money sink and can be a godsend or a total waste; and the effect they have is... well, random. The increase and decrease of party membership can equally well be a godsend or a total waste. Die Macher slowly turns into a [i]long[/i] plodding game of randomness management, with little room for clever interactive play apart from kicking each other\\'s shins en route. Perhaps then a game of Massilia or Vanuatu is then more appropriate: played in a third of the time it takes to finish Die Macher both titles take a simple core and [i]keep[/i] it simple while introducing plenty of shinkicking.  The other problem I had, adding points with a large dynamic range together, remains as-is. It makes matters very hard to determine whether or not to go for a particular state or not. The fact that the same issue is still very much alive in a game like Russian Railroads which appeared 27 or 28 years after Die Macher (!!) illustrates that people apparently like this sort of thing. \\'You cannot know who is winning!\\', or something similar. Why is that a Good Thing in a game lasting for 3 to 4 hours? Is uncertainty in who will win the only thing that keeps players going through this non-neglegible timeframe? That\\'s rather patronising, innit?  Finally, the artwork in the VG edition is lousy for gameplay, because it is difficult to see what others have lying in front of them. Also annoying is the large amount of rules issues which were introduced into the 3rd Edition. Kevin Nesbitt at one point assured everyone that utmost care had gone into recasting the rules, with the best interests of the game at heart... Shame he didn\\'t really bother closing all these annoying loopholes. Official answers are not really forthcoming unless you go back to the 2nd Edition rules Valley Games rejected in the first place. *Duh!* Fortunately VG are dead in the water so this sort of crap is no longer unleashed upon the unsuspecting player.  In any case, my end conclusion is that Die Macher remains overly long and overly overwrought. It was nice to have played several full games at very long last, but it was not an experience which had me interested for much more. I\\'ve increased the rate somewhat, but that\\'s where it\\'s going to stay. Too long (6 hours) and the game came down to a dice roll  Long and repetitive.  No interest in getting this to the table again. Whoa, what a big, unwieldy, long, unnecessarily complex, fiddly - and at the same time very intriguing - design! It seems to have at least twice as many moving parts as is needed for a good heavyw-eight euro, but it does seem to hang together very well despite of it. I finally got this to the table and must confess I had a hard time enjoying it. This was due in large part to taking on both explaining and facilitating the game without having played it before as well as some frustrating behavior from other players, few of whom seemed to be enjoying the game themselves. Add to this the poor graphic design, the senselessly skyrocketing inflation, and other clunky aspects of this extremely long game, and it\\'s tough to be excited about playing it again. I definitely prefer Dominant Species for a \"multidimensional majorities\" game, so coalitions, which seem to be the uniquely interesting part of this game, to really distinguish it the next time around.  UPDATE: I had a similar experience (muddling through rules, facilitating while playing, whining players) with Struggle of Empires, but I still enjoyed that game, so I\\'m thinking this rating might end up sticking. Furthermore, that game\\'s excellent Alliance system makes playing this just to \"try out\" coalition play less intriguing. Basically, Dominant Species and Struggle of Empires seem to cover all the bases I\\'m interested in for a long game. Dry, incomprehensible to non-Germans, perhaps the biggest letdown of any German game I\\'ve ever bought.  Boring subject and had no idea what was being simulated.  On the positive side, at least I don\\'t have to deal with this confusing electoral system in real life, since I don\\'t live in Germany.  Nobody liked it at our table.  Sold. Given Away The core idea here is you place cubes into regions and then those cubes become worth points based on how many of the issue cards in that region align to the issue cards in front of you. For having the most points in a region, you also get the special reward of trying to groom the endgame scoring requirements to match what issues you want them to be. The game has some decent amount of flip luck, and planning too much to set up future turns has a way of backfiring pretty easily as players slip the issues cards, and your multipliers out from under you. Ultimately I found this game a little too complicated, chaotic and long.   :nostar: Art and components :nostar: Innovative mechanics :star: Handles 5 or more players :nostar: Good with different player counts :star: Low time between turns :nostar: Comfortable complexity :star: Re-playability :star::nostar::nostar: Enjoyment I had quite a high intial rating for this game.  But after 5 full games, a pattern developed that really turned me off.  Understanding who is in the lead and what actions will result in zero benefit to a player (but screwage to another) apparently escapes about 25-50% of the players of this game.  The result is someone winning that didn\\'t understand how it happened, and a number of back-markers either pissed because they know what happened but couldn\\'t stop it, or thinking they just got unlucky because they didn\\'t understand the consequences of their actions.  The other disturbing element is that once everyone has money (turn 3+), everyone is maxing out their available actions and it comes down to who is rolling better, who has a few more euros for an opinion poll auction, and how those random opinion polls come out.  Theoretically, if you subtracted the bull-in-the-china-shop newbs out of the game and everyone understoood the consequences of various actions, and those same people played without AP to make the game a reasonable length, I could see this being a sublime experience.  So my rating stays a \\'4\\' and if this group of experts invites me to a game I will play, but never again with novices.  영향력 게임.  특히 앞을 내다보며 준비하는 영향력 게임.  이런 종류는 젬병이라 힘듬. 그래도 게임은 괜찮음. Die Macher left me unimpressed, however, in the game\\'s defense, we apparently played something wrong whereby people had way, way, way more options to swap cards in and out than they should\\'ve. I found the game tedious with how much matching it asked you to do by setting yourself up a turn ahead only to have one or more people just swap out cards you wanted. It felt dumb to spend 3-4 hours constantly rebuilding my sandcastle and have others tear it down with ease. I lost by a mere 6 points though.  I\\'m wasn\\'t enthralled by the procedural turn structure of the game which, like most procedural games, kept the game plodding along instead of taking off. [i]We do this. OK, that’s over. Now we do this. OK, that’s over. Now we…[/i] There just isn\\'t enough there for me to understand the game\\'s reputation. It\\'s a set matching game with both the game board and other players.   I wasn\\'t clear on what the ostensible fun of the game is -- the alliances? They seemed rather obvious. I can’t see the justification for the length of explanation vs interesting decisions. Despite our rules infraction, my gut says I don\\'t need to revisit this one.  Too Long, boring and repetitive for me. Will never play again. A repetitive, overlong procedural experience with a lot more chaos than you\\'d expect from a game known as a venerable classic of the heavy euro class. Die Macher feels greatly outdated. The game overstays it\\'s welcome with a 5hr playtime of repetitive actions. I love negotiation, realistic, money games but this one felt stale. You can get stuck with bad draws with not much to change it, get awful dice rolls that can greatly affect vp, income, have a hard time getting into coalitions because of bad hand draws. Not to mention the common complaint of bidding on hidden polls. I\\'m sure 30 years ago this was outstanding, but with all the games out nowadays this gets a thumbs down. Die Macher shows how far euro games have come. Its an incredibly overdrawn game that has far too many systems layered upon each other. The game is also highly procedural, making the protracted play time insufferable, as even small decisions take several minutes to play out. The shadow cabinet and polling cards are neat ideas, but are drowned beneath the menagerie of auxiliary mechanisms. The game also implements blind bidding in an unfortunate way, and has far too many random elements for a game of its length. While I\\'m sure Die Macher was the cream of the crop decades ago, but now it feels antiquated and obsoleted by modern game designs. Played once with some good friends and to be honest, I don\\'t have any idea how to rate this thing. I\\'m sure that it is a masterpiece of game design and I trust that there is some absurdly abstract level on which all of Die Macher\\'s moving parts link together to form a wooden cube-fueled engine of Euro-elegant perfection, but years of playing games with lasers, dinosaurs, spellcasting, explosions, etc. prevents my Ameritrash-rotted mind from tapping that divine lattice. Only one game played with three players short game Valley edition, which I suspect is not a sweet spot for the game.  For a game that takes so long, there are too many wild swings.  If the change of a media ownership can change a card which influence someones handshake level by  2, and someone elses by -2, that\\'s a potential swing of 40 votes between two players.  The opinion polls are precisely the same.  Coalitions seem designed to screw over players, and there is a significant undercurrent in the game to play negatively rather than positively, which would always leave someone around the table with a sour taste in their mouth.  If it wasn\\'t so long, this would be OK, but if I am playing a game of this length, I really want it to be a lot less swingy, and more palatable for everyone around the table. It is a grandparent of Modern Euros...but it does not meen that I have to like it! I\\'ll never be a German politician.  This game shows its age.  I wish I could see what the fuss is about. It\\'s ok. Probably the best political election boardgame I\\'ve played but this fact only reveals the abysmal quality of political boardgames rather than the quality of this one. (NB Unless you count Kremlin as an election game in which case this is a far second best).  This game was once ahead of its time, which explains the near-legendary status of this title, but its best days are now behind it.  Die Macher is long.  But its greatest sin isn\\'t the length, it\\'s that luck can completely screw a player - for the entire game.  I\\'m talking about the draw of a player\\'s hand of issue cards.  A bad hand can make for a long game.  And the methods of changing a bad draw are also subject to luck.  Die Macher is repetitive.  The first, second and third rounds are the same as the fourth and fifth.  The seventh round is different, but not significantly so.  It\\'s seven long rounds of the same thing over and over again.  Die Macher is tedious.  The bean-counting in this game is like work.  And your gray matter might be slightly scarred afterwards, and not in a good way.  There are much better titles out there, especially for the time investment.  I\\'ll be avoiding this in the future.  Way toooooooo long. This is uber boring game. It may play an important role in games history ... but let\\'s leave it there. An impressive game, but ultimately rather tedious. Part of the problem is that winning the last round is so important.  If you\\'re going to play, definitely download some player aids such as the \"summary-1-3a.pdf\" series to help you keep track of what happens during each phase and of the variations in the mechanisms used, such as when each type of auction ends and whether someone who passes is allowed to bid again later during the same auction. Abstract representations of German politics -- so abstract that it has very little sense of politics at all.  (If everyone pours in resources into a single state, it just means that that state has more points to give out, when the results should be zero-sum.)  Graphic design of pieces is poor. Played it once in 2008 and it never made it to the table again and I don’t regret that for a second. it\\'s a longer, more complicated, more random version of El Grande... 3 reasons to make it 1/3rd the game (or less) Far too convoluted for my taste. This is a game that goes on too long.  There are too many stages to each turn, and the payoff is weak.  I would not play this game again. Long, tedious, uninteresting. Completely overrated.  Way too much game for what is accomplished.  Yawnfest.  Do you like arithmetic? Do you like following a tedious procedure? Then boy do I have the game for you! Interesting and complicated game.. I just really dislike it at the same time. Duncan likes it and there aren\\'t many copies in our gaming circles, so we keep it, but I doubt I\\'ll ever play it again. Un par de partidas no registradas.  Conceptualmente no es un mal juego, el problema está en que es antiguo y al compararlo con diseños más actuales se ven todas sus errores y carencias.  - La partida es laaaaaarga y acortarla no es posible pq las estrategias son a largo plazo en muchos casos. Si se da un tijeretazo y se acorta el nº de elecciones, el juego pierde gran parte de su jugo.  - La estética de las cartas no es nada intuitiva y francamente mejorable.  - Puede resultar repetitivo pq son varias las elecciones y casi todas son iguales.  - Demasiado conteo de votos.   - Para un no-alemán con ningún conocimiento de las elecciones en alemania, hay muchas reglas y mecánicas que resultan incomprensibles.    Creo que para alemanes, y en los inicios de los eurogames, pudo tener su sentido. Ahora, comparándolo con diseños más actuales lo veo anticuado por no decir obsoleto. Well, it\\'s REALLY chaotic and barely controllable if at all. Mixes the complexity of Dominant Species with the negotiations-caused chaos of A Game of Thrones. Not sure if it is actually a good mix. The [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamecategory/1026/negotiation]negotiation mechanic[/url], singling out particular opponents for targeted attacks, important hidden trackable information (money) - this game has almost every mechanic I regularly dislike in games (except [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2685/player-elimination]player elimination[/url]). Moreover, I found several elements considerably too luck based for a game that lasts as long as this - particularly, bidding on hidden poll cards of wildly varying strength and important die rolls with wildly varying results. My rating of 3 already includes a +1 bonus for the theme, which is right up my alley and was the reason I wanted to try out the game. I would otherwise rate it with the very bad 2. (Rating and comment are based on the [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameversion/24939/german-second-edition]German second edition[/url].) too drab Plus: very good and realistic theme. Minus: very high entry barrier vs unpredictibility and play time. After second round I had impression that nothing exciting will happen till the end. Just boring repetition round by round with huge luck factor. With that complexity I would expect a chance to build a combo that might work. None of this. Pity. I was really excited about it until I played. The randomness is unbearable, even worse than the randomest ameritrash. It\\'s ok to have player interaction, it\\'s less ok if your scoring decreases by a factor of 3 or 4 in a single round, without having any possibility of controlling it. Avoid at all cost if you want to have a sane game experience. There are better and more modern alternatives. too abstract, uninteresting theme, lengthy Very tedious and NOT fun! It looks good and I am sure that there is a game in there somewhere, but this is DEFINATELY not for me. Most likely it is the theme which is the big turn off. This game is far too random for the amount of time and effort it takes to play it. After 1 Play: Quite a let-down for me.  I didn\\'t think it was nearly as \\'heavy\\' as people say.  There is far too much luck here for a game of this length: Dice rolling, card drawing, investing in areas with a mostly unknown payoff, and being forced to bid on face-down cards of wildly varying usefulness.  Any of these factors (except bidding for face-down cards) would be fine in a shorter game, but I\\'m not going to invest an entire day into a game only to have my chances shattered by a single card draw.  I think the high rating is due in large part to the legendary status this game acquired while out of print. Not at all interesting. A very complicated game the first time through. There\\'s alot to keep track of, so it\\'s hard to come up with a good strategy your first time. Well, for me at least. This game feels more like an exercise in bookkeeping. I keep hearing the same comments made about this game, \"It takes a bunch of plays before you really understand the strategy\". I don\\'t want to sit through a painfully dull 4+ hour game several times before I even have an inkling of the strategy. I\\'d rather eat a thumbtack. Wow. Why do people like this? Way, way way too much luck, especially for such a long game - but even at half the length, still awful. I would never play this again. It takes more than an hour to explain the rules, if you survive that and have five more hours you may enjoy this complex game, but only if you don\\'t mind the considerable luck element in a gamer\\'s game. One lucky card after five hours of play can win or lose the game for you. Luck certainly has some role in real elections as well. I think this is one of the most overrated games on BGG. Highest rated game on BGG from the year 1986. Unnecessarily complex rules for not so complex game with a lot of cards. Game is way overrated(33) and overweighted (4.4). Update 11.11.18 to 2: Was cool while it lasted, and a unique experience but is ridiculously long and annoying in many regards. Way too long for what it is, and no amount of skill can make up for being excluded from player deals In spite of its simple design, and being an \"open system\" game, it bores me to death... and having all the time it takes in my hands, I would ceartinly choose any other game or activity. Dull, tedious political adult game that goes on WAYYYYYYYYYYY TOO LOOOOOONNG. Grr - Maybe again if I get to peruse the rules. I don\\'t mind long-taking games, but this one is just terrible.
